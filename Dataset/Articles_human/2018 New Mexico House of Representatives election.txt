The 2018 New Mexico House of Representatives election took place as part of the biennial United States elections. New Mexico voters elected state representatives in all 70 of the state house's districts. State representatives serve two-year terms in the New Mexico House of Representatives.
A primary election on June 5, 2018, determined which candidates appeared on the November 6 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained from the New Mexico Secretary of State's website.
In the 2016 state House elections, Democrats flipped five seats from Republican hands and took control of the House by increasing their seats from 33 to 38. This put Democrats in effective control of the New Mexico House of Representatives.
To claim control of the chamber from Democrats, the Republicans needed to net four House seats. However, in the elections, the Democrats made a net gain of eight seats, increasing their seats from 38 to 46.
