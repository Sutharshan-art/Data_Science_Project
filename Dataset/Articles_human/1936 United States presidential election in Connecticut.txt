The 1936 United States presidential election in Connecticut was held on November 3, 1936, as part of the 1936 United States presidential election. The state voters chose eight electors to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Connecticut voted for Democratic Party candidate and incumbent President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who won the state by a margin of 14.97%.
As of 2020, this remains the last election in which Connecticut voted to the right of Nebraska. Roosevelt was the first Democrat to carry the state since 1912, the first to carry it with a majority of the popular vote since Grover Cleveland in 1892, and the first to carry Tolland County since 1852.
