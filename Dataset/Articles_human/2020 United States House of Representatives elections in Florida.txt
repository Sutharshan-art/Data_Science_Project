The 2020 United States House of Representatives elections in Florida were held on November 3, 2020, to elect the 27 U.S. representatives from Florida, one from each of the state's 27 congressional districts. The elections coincided with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the House of Representatives, elections to the U.S. Senate, and various state and local elections.
In what was considered an upset, the Republican Party retook the two seats that it lost to the Democrats in 2018, expanding its 14–13 majority to 16–11.
