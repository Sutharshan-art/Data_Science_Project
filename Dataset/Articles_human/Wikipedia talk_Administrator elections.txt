If we're going to try to do the next election 5 months after the previous one, are we basically at the point pretty much right now where we should be announcing when the signup period starts? Valereee (talk) 02:07, 11 February 2025 (UTC)

I believe we have to do the full process reauthorization RFC first. Not sure where that would leave the schedule, though. Perfect4th (talk) 02:13, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
@Perfect4th, sorry, I'm clearly missing something...full process reauthorization RfC? Valereee (talk) 02:18, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
Valereee, I don't see anything explicitly stated on WP:AELECT at the moment, but the recent RFC for workshopping election details says This RfC will not discuss reauthorization of administrator elections; that will be decided on in a follow up RFC after the RFCs on this page are all closed. The idea is to improve the process as much as possible first, then later have a straight up and down vote about renewal. Seems to have also been discussed in #Planning for post debrief above (which of course I saw only after I chased more obscure revisions). Happy editing, Perfect4th (talk) 02:23, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
Hm...not actually sure what that even means. @Novem Linguae, can you translate? Valereee (talk) 02:51, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
The 2024 RfA review proposal only resulted in admin elections being approved for a one-time trial run. We need the community to approve it again to make it a permanent feature. Toadspike [Talk] 03:02, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
Good grief. Valereee (talk) 03:09, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
I've got a feeling it will snow-yes, based on the community feedback. Hopefully it won't be much of a timesink BugGhost ü¶óüëª 07:51, 11 February 2025 (UTC)
I also think the RFC will pass easily. Hopefully an infinite renewal, not just an additional trial. There's probably multiple blockers for the next election though:
renewal RFC
WMF needs to make a couple changes to the SecurePoll software, then permit it to be used locally on enwiki (phab:T378287, phab:T384302). WMF recently hired contractors to work on SecurePoll, so I think this will move forward shortly.
Once those are cleared, it should be easy to turn this into a recurring process.
I purposely put the word "ideally" into the RFC question about how often to have admin elections. I think the next election will happen whenever all the blockers are solved, then after that we can try to hit the 5 month cadence a little more strictly. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 10:06, 11 February 2025 (UTC)

 MediaWiki message delivery (talk) 06:21, 21 February 2025 (UTC)

I know, what an important detail. Currently, the name of this heading is "Who can vote" in the present tense and "Who could vote" in the past tense, as seen on ADE and the October 2024 subpage. I don't think we should be changing the name of this heading every time an election finishes, so could we settle on a name with some more permanence? I suggest "Voter eligibility". Aaron Liu (talk) 17:14, 22 February 2025 (UTC)

In general, re-writing pages for past elections to be in the past tense should, in my view, not be done. With a clear indication of the status of the election at the top, there's no need to change the rest of the page as no one will be confused that the election is still ongoing. I think people coming to see the page in future would be more likely to want to see the state as it appeared during voting, and not a reworded page. isaacl (talk) 17:29, 22 February 2025 (UTC)
I was the person who split the Oct '24 details into the separate subpage and turned everything past-tense - just wanted to say that I don't really have much preference on this, it just felt like it made grammatical sense at the time seeing as the page was created after the election had ran (when it run running, details of the trial were just on the main WP:AELECT page). I've got no opinion on what happens in future elections' subpages, and wouldn't object if someone made the Oct 2024 subpage present tense (I don't think it would be worth doing, but I also won't attempt to stop anyone). "Voter eligibility" sounds like a good header to me. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 00:32, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
I'll just change it to that, then. My main concern was with link stability. (As for the tense of page content... I have no preference, since it is virtually impossible to be tense-neutral in English.) Aaron Liu (talk) 03:31, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
Do we really need to be this exclusionary? Let's keep it at a name everybody understands ‚ÄîFemke üê¶ (talk) 07:27, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
Do you have a tense-neutral suggestion? Aaron Liu (talk) 15:18, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
Present tense feels sufficiently neutral for this, right? ‚ÄîFemke üê¶ (talk) 15:20, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
No, because it is present tense and will be changed into the past tense, which breaks links. With ACE also changing content to the past tense I'm not sure if there's consensus to not rewrite into the past tense. This isn't any important enough for me to push it, though, so you're free to change it back if you wish. Aaron Liu (talk) 16:08, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
I don't agree that a verb "will be changed into the past tense", and I don't think this should be a consideration in choosing a heading. That being said, I don't have a problem with using "Voter eligibility". isaacl (talk) 16:38, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
The truth is, people are spontaneously changing verbs to the past tense, as seen at ACE. Aaron Liu (talk) 16:46, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
It happened in 2023 at the arbitration committee elections page, but not in 2024 (yet), and has not happened for all past elections (as of when I checked in 2023). It leads to very stilted language and doesn't bring any particular benefit. If a trend develops, I think determining a practice by consensus would be warranted, but I don't think it's necessary yet. (On a technical point, someone changing a heading could add an anchor to preserve older links. I didn't mention this before because I think the re-writing shouldn't be done anyway.) isaacl (talk) 17:11, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
special:Diff/1262010917. Nothing else was changed 2024 but that's more of an oversight. Anchors can be added, but the editors who spontaneously change the tense are unlikely to realize that. Aaron Liu (talk) 17:15, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
No, not an oversight. I didn't object to that brief change made in the lead sentence, but I will object if the rest of the page gets altered, after having posted my view on this matter in 2023. isaacl (talk) 17:22, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
I have the same position you have, then. (Though I think that all headings should just be tense-neutral.) Aaron Liu (talk) 20:03, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
With little copy edits like this, probably best to just make the change, and anyone that doesn't like it can revert it. Will save us 650 words of discussion :) ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 17:13, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
I think it was worthwhile to mention the broader issue. I feel what best serves future readers is to preserve the appearance of the page as it was during the vote. Perhaps it would be helpful to have a status banner at the top, similar as with the arbitration committee elections, so the current state of the election is clearly identified. isaacl (talk) 17:18, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
We did have a status banner at the top; it was only removed this month. There was rough consensus to make it just an ombox, and I did make what is now {{Administrator elections status}} based on the ACE status header, but I misconfigured it spectacularly during the trial election; while the misconfiguration has been fixed, I'm not sure if we'll get consensus to adopt that automatically-updating template instead of the manually-updated header template we had. Aaron Liu (talk) 20:08, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
I was referring to the individual election pages. When the next election page is created, it could have a status banner to highlight the current state of that specific election and eventually its results. It wouldn't be a lot different than the current lead sentence at Wikipedia:Administrator elections/October 2024, but some editors like to have that info given additional emphasis. isaacl (talk) 23:10, 23 February 2025 (UTC)
The header is the header for the election pages. Aaron Liu (talk) 00:21, 24 February 2025 (UTC)
That header currently solicits participation in the past RfCs. My suggestion is for a header that just describes the state of the election and which never gets modified again after the election is closed and the results are announced. isaacl (talk) 00:28, 24 February 2025 (UTC)

Hello all. I got a question offwiki about when the next election date would be. Right now the next election is blocked on two things:

renewal RFC outcome
phab:T384302 SecurePoll: Restrict creation of foreign and global elections
If the renewal RFC closes as option C, I think the date of the 2nd election will be a bit off the 5 month schedule (a bit random and depends on when the blockers are resolved, setup time, etc.), then elections after that will be on the 5 month schedule.
If the renewal RFC closes as option B, same thing, except the potential 3rd election will probably also be off the 5 month schedule.
Hope that helps with advising candidates on whether to wait for AELECT or choose RFA. Happy electing! ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 20:56, 3 April 2025 (UTC)

Update: The RFC is now closed. If there aren't any forthcoming close challenges, the remaining blocker is now phab:T384302 SecurePoll: Restrict creation of foreign and global elections. I have written two patches that should resolve this ticket. Might take a couple weeks to go through the code review and deployment process, and get signoff from WMF leadership. Getting SecurePoll approved for local use (what this ticket is about) isn't a total blocker, but it allows SecurePoll elections to be held without having to bug WMF Trust & Safety, who are busy. It makes the entire process quicker, more scalable, and able to handle the recommended 5 month cadence. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 23:20, 9 April 2025 (UTC)
When those tickets are fully dealt with, we should probably wait a few weeks before having another election. I also think that after the next election is when we start counting the 5 month schedule. fanfanboy (blocktalk) 01:38, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
Yeap. Agreed. I think the steps after securepoll local elections being ready on the technical side is picking some English Wikipedia election admins (scrutineers). This will be our first time doing that so may require some extra time. Then proposing a schedule on this talk page and getting it approved. Then doing a call for candidates. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 04:08, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
Would eyeing something like June-July 2025 be feasible for AELECT 2? Or is it too soon to consider without more info on the other blockers? Soni (talk)  11:29, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
Sounds about right. If I had to guess, I think we can get the software stuff wrapped up in one month, then another month for picking scrutineers and planning. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 11:35, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
I hope I'm not re-litigating an RfC outcome that took months of time and thousands of words but ... why five months, not six to make it twice a year? HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts? 11:41, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
I think the idea behind the 5 month RFC close was to stagger the elections so that if someone is always busy during certain months, that eventually AELECT would occur in a month where they are not busy. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 11:50, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
So that they will drift seasonally, rather than always being at the same times each year. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 14:43, 10 April 2025 (UTC)
Fair enough. Thanks for the answers. HJ Mitchell | Penny for your thoughts? 15:55, 10 April 2025 (UTC)

Congratulations, all AELECT supporters and commenters! Many users, especially User:Novem Linguae & User:theleekycauldron deserve wide praise for demonstrating how an engaged community may adapt to broad input and make informed AND complex decisions about its future. We went to the well of consensus over and over, and those who supported individual elements of the surveys became broader supporters of the entire movement. The model used for acquiring a neutral consensus moving the process forward was well founded and might be used for other longterm issues moving forward. Bravo! For my part, I fully believe in this election process and the steps made to enshrine elections as policy. I thank everyone who participated. BusterD (talk) 13:53, 21 April 2025 (UTC)

I've drafted an RFC at Wikipedia:Administrator elections/SecurePoll permissions RFC. It is not open yet. Please feel free to give feedback here. Basically we already had an RFC that approved creating an "Election Administrator" user group, but after thinking about it more I think it'd be less messy to just give all the SecurePoll create/edit/scrutinize permissions to the existing CheckUser group. Thoughts? ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 23:52, 11 April 2025 (UTC)

It feels to me that creating and editing should be one group, and scrutineering should be another. I'm not sure on the technical side of this, but can we not append scrutineering rights to checkusers, and allow the new electionadmin group to just create/edit (but not scrutineer) elections? BugGhost ü¶óüëª 00:11, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
When will these RFCs come to an end! But yeah I agree with BugGhost on this one. fanfanboy (blocktalk) 00:21, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
When will these RFCs come to an end? Hopefully soon :) If this change is small enough, maybe I can just post at WP:VPPR with a "does anybody object?" type message. Will give this some more thought, and hopefully some others will chime in too. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 00:49, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
We've had a quite a few RFCs, and as there may still be (a rather important) one to come about WP:RECALL, I think there's good merit in the simple message option instead. It still provides an opportunity to raise concerns or even request using an RFC after all if people do want that. Also agree with BugGhost on the scrutineer aspect but I'm really not bothered either way. Perfect4th (talk) 01:25, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
+1. It seems like a problem solvable by a simple well notified discussion than a full RFC. We're fairly deep in implementation land Soni (talk)  10:26, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
+2 agreed, I see no need for a full RfC. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 16:40, 13 April 2025 (UTC)
Adding a new role would indeed create needless process / procedure. Bundling it into an existing position is probably the best option. But why checkuser? Checkuser makes perfect sense for scrutineering since they can already view that data. But the task here is more like admin election clerking. To me, it feels more intuitive to give this right to the bureaucrats? Leijurv (talk) 07:25, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
There are only 16 crats - assigning a role to them is likely to put a bottleneck on the process, and we don't have any indication that they want to take on this additional set of tasks, especially if it is working with something complex and niche like securepoll. I think a specialised self-nominating group would be best for setting up elections, even if it means more legwork right now to organise that group. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 10:04, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
That is a fair point.
Why not give the right to all sysops? Leijurv (talk) 13:40, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
Something that is complex and niche shouldn't be handed out broadly to people with no need for it and no guaranteed aptitude for it. Rights like this are the entire reason that small usergroups exist, and while there will of necessity be some process and procedure associated with the right, absolutely none of that will be needless and there is no reason it for it to be lightweight. The process and requirements for Wikipedia:Interface administrators seem like a good model for this, although I don't see a need to require 2FA or CSS/JS knowledge. Thryduulf (talk) 14:29, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
The previous RfC to which you linked found consensus to enable the electionadmin right, but did not specify that a specific user group had to be created (An RFC to determine how the new right should be distributed can be launched at any time...). I think there should be more discussion about the details of other potential processes for granting the right than just granting it to the checkusers group (the three basic ways being by consensus agreement on request, by appointment from some group, or by election). Also, given the resolution of Phabricator ticket T377531, there is the ability to separate poll administration tasks from scrutineering tasks, so that's something to consider when deciding how to manage the election admin role. isaacl (talk) 15:34, 12 April 2025 (UTC)
I don't think it would be controversial for CU's to get electionadmin rights in addition to the scrutineering right which was decided in the previous RfC.
I'd say this can be devised as similar to the edit filter manager group, which has rights not included in sysop group by default but can be self-granted by sysops. Reusing the IA requirements seems slightly too restrictive. 0xDeadbeef‚Üí‚àû (talk to me) 13:10, 15 April 2025 (UTC)
Though upon further thought, config editing seems outside the job descriptions of CUs.. 0xDeadbeef‚Üí‚àû (talk to me) 13:15, 15 April 2025 (UTC)
I think that the best choice is between the model of Wikipedia:Interface administrators and Wikipedia:Edit filter manager.  A separate user group makes sense in the absence of explicit consensus to bundle it, but we don't need a heavy-weight process to assign membership.  Eluchil404 (talk) 23:27, 21 April 2025 (UTC)

Hi all,
Based on the discussions over at Wikipedia talk:Administrator elections/SecurePoll permissions proposal, I realised that there's not a lot of certainty in the community about how SecurePoll's config really works, so I've done some local testing and tried to collate a basic summary of what I've found about it in the hopes to get a bit more community clarity on this. It's available at User:Bugghost/Securepoll notes. It is still a work-in-progress and I plan to add more to it over the coming days. Anyone is free to edit it if they've found anything incorrect, and please let me know if there's anything in particular you'd like me (or anyone else) to test and I'll try to add it to the page. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 20:17, 29 April 2025 (UTC)

Fantastic, thank you so much! Assuming we will use an encrypted poll, my question is about the period after the poll is over. Is it possible for a scrutineer who possesses the private key to see who voted for who? For instance, could they view the total tally, then strike someone's vote, then view the tally again to see whose count was decremented, thus learning who that user voted for? Leijurv (talk) 22:02, 29 April 2025 (UTC)
Very good question - from my testing it looks like yes an election clerk or scrutineer can look at the tally, then strike a particular user's vote, compare the tally to see who that user voted for, and then unstrike the vote again to cover their tracks. This can be done on an encrypted poll as long as the election clerk/scrutineer has the correct encryption keys to examine the tallies. There is a public log at Special:SecurePollLog (if logging is turned on), but it looks like it only tracks when tallies are requested (so in this scenario would be twice - before and after the vote strike) - but surprisingly this log doesn't show when a vote gets struck or unstruck. Election clerks/scrutineers can see if a particular vote has been struck/unstruck, but that information is not easily visible, and it is not accessible at all to the general public. Seems like a bit of an oversight here. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 17:28, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
That's probably a bug that should be reported on Phabricator, although I'm not sure what could be done about it and even without revealing whose vote was struck/unstruck the multiple unauthorized tallies will leave an audit trail a mile long.  Finally Special:SecurePollLog is not public - only election clerks can access it (it's gated on securepoll-create-poll which is strange). * Pppery * it has begun... 17:49, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Looks like you're right about SecurePollLog not being public - sorry about that, I've struck the above. I agree that it's not obvious what could/should be done to mitigate this. Maybe a new poll option to specifically only allow one tally to ever be generated? BugGhost ü¶óüëª 17:59, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Or possibly a log entry for votes being struck or unstruck, so the log would read something like:
18:57 30 April 2025 (UTC) Example requested tally for poll #42
18:58 30 April 2025 (UTC) Example struck 1 vote on poll #42
18:58 30 April 2025 (UTC) Example requested tally for poll #42
18:59 30 April 2025 (UTC) Example unstruck 1 vote on poll #42
At the very least that would be cause to ask Example what they were doing and why. If it is possible to leave edit summaries when striking votes then they could be displayed in this log too (if the log is restricted to the same people who can strike and unstrike votes then I don't think that would have any security implications?). Thryduulf (talk) 18:59, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
In the meantime we could put a policy that no one shall click Tally until all scrutineers have publicly declared (ratified) that they are done scrutineering. This is verifiable, and if everyone can be seen to have followed this policy, it is certain none of them used this trick. Leijurv (talk) 19:47, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Does it ever make sense to strike votes after tallying? Is there some reason SecurePoll couldn't prohibit that operation entirely? * Pppery * it has begun... 21:12, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
I don't think striking votes after tallying should happen in usual course of action. I think that operation could be prohibited, but it would require changing the code. The only downside I could think of is accidentally or maliciously tallying early. If there was no way to strike votes after that, it would spoil the election and I guess everyone would have to re-vote (with new scrutineers). I guess a more ideal solution would be that all (or a majority?) of scrutineers must request a tally before the code actually does it? (Instead of just 1 scrutineer saying they're done, most, or all of them would have to). But this is overcomplicated and shouldn't be considered a blocker for AELECT, because we can just have the scrutineers agree not to tally until everyone has ratified. Leijurv (talk) 21:23, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Filed phab:T393057. And I agree none of these are blockers for local elections - they're paranoid nice-to-haves. * Pppery * it has begun... 21:35, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Strikes are logged. The fact that they're logged in a different place than anything else is weird, and may make that sort of chichanery harder to find, but ultimately harmless. * Pppery * it has begun... 21:48, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Where are they logged at? ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 22:23, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
(from looking at the code, not tested locally) If you go to the details page for a specific vote it should show the log of any strike/unstrike actions affecting that vote. * Pppery * it has begun... 22:36, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
This aligns with what I've been seeing. I've added a screenshot to the notes page to illustrate. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 08:36, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
This sounds like a reason for the encryption key not to be shared with the scrutineers, and thus to have a non-scrutineer electionadmin to be a backup to the electionadmin who created the poll. isaacl (talk) 22:30, 30 April 2025 (UTC)
Just to clarify: any election clerk is able to do the above, regardless of if they are scrutineers - any election clerk is able to request tallies and strike/unstrike votes. From my testing, the only difference between and election clerk and a scrutineer is that a scrutineer can see IP addresses and user agents (ie. browser versions) of voters and an election clerk cannot. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 18:45, 1 May 2025 (UTC)
Thanks for the clarification. This means that electionadmins must also be trusted to only strike votes in accordance with community guidance. isaacl (talk) 22:05, 1 May 2025 (UTC)
They have to be added to the election to do anything with it, though. Typically for past Arbcom elections the election comission has been removed from the election on votewiki when it starts, leaving only the scrutineers (and WMF staff) able to strike votes, and we could do the same for local elections * Pppery * it has begun... 04:31, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
At least one electionadmin has to remain in order to tally the results, and for redundancy, there should be at least two. When the vote is run on the WMF voting server, it makes sense to add electionadmins from English Wikipedia in order to manage the poll until voting time, to avoid taking up the time of WMF staff. But when running the poll on the English Wikipedia server, I don't think additional electionadmins need to be added beyond those who must be there to do the tallying. isaacl (talk) 14:55, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
You could also revoke the right just during the election ? (Basically two people get the right, setup securepoll and then have their permissions revoked. The election then runs and once it is over the right is regranted, the votes and struck, counted and the rights are revoked again). It might be a fair bit of bureaucracy but it would sidestep the problem of peeps tallying the vote before the end. Sohom (talk) 15:13, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
The issue is with someone having the ability to strike votes and tally them after the poll ends. (I still don't see a need for extra electionadmins to be assigned who won't be part of the process to tally votes.) isaacl (talk) 15:33, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Right, my personal opinion is that we should have only two folks with electionadmin at a time (one to actually do the sensitive work and one to perform a oversight/contingency role). We can always assign more folks if we see that there is a need for other contingency folks. Sohom (talk) 16:23, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Personally I'm OK with users only holding the electionadmin right for the period when they are using it for a specific poll, and with the self-assignment process this is workable with minimal overhead. I appreciate, though, that others don't think it's necessary to be that strict with who currently holds the electionadmin right, as long as the number of users assigned to manage a given poll is tightly managed. isaacl (talk) 17:07, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
I think we don't need to worry too much about who actually has the election clerk rights and when. Personally I would like the election clerk role to be widely adopted so that Special:SecurePollLogs can be watched by a sizable number of people to see if there's any unnecessary tally-generations. I agree the more important issue is deciding who is actually added to a poll at a given time. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 18:07, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
This all sounds a bit complicated. Would recommend copying what WMF does and what we did for the first admin election, and have one electionclerk and three scrutineers. The three scrutineers have the same perms as electionclerks, so in theory this gives us four election clerks. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 19:04, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
I think there should be at least one backup election clerk who is not a scrutineer with whom the encryption key is shared, so they can trigger a vote tally if necessary. isaacl (talk) 21:09, 2 May 2025 (UTC)

It looks as though the final technical changes to enable AELECT to run smoothly on English Wikipedia are moving forward and should be implemented soon. With that major task near-complete, it's time to think about scheduling our first non-trial elections. For simplicity's sake, we can wait out May to make sure everything is 100% ready, and aim for a June election. Proposed calendar:

June 3-10: Call for candidates, Tuesday to Tuesday to include a full weekend
June 11-15: Discussion phase, again including a full weekend
June 16-22: Voting phase, including a full weekend
June 23 to close - scrutineering and tallying, promote successful candidates.
With this schedule, we'd want to have a few election clerks volunteer in the first few days of June, though technically they wouldn't be needed until the voting phase begins on June 16th. Scrutineers could also be asked to volunteer ahead of time. Thoughts? ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 16:25, 2 May 2025 (UTC)

My only thought is that this would put the voting period for the following elections at the same time as the voting period for the ArbCom elections (based on it being similar to the 2024 dates). I think it would be ideal to avoid that until admin elections are more established to reduce potential confusion, etc. Moving it circa 2 weeks forwards or backwards would resolve this I think. Thryduulf (talk) 17:04, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Personally, I'd rather adjust the dates for any election in November/December if desired, than the one happening five months earlier. The rotating through the year approach means that eventually the problem will be encountered again, so I think it's sufficient to be flexible for the dates of the actual election in conflict. (The arbitration committee election dates could shift, for all we know at this time.) isaacl (talk) 17:17, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
If the technical changes are resolved fairly promptly, we could have a May/June election that runs from May 20th to June 9th, which would enable a October/November election ahead of Arbcom elections this fall. We could also use the June 3-23rd dates and then hold the fall election October 20th-November 9th anyway. I don't think we need to be super strict on the 5-month period between elections (after all, each election takes a few weeks) as long as we're close. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 17:21, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
For the technical reasons you discussed with Novem below, I recognize that a May 20th to June 9th admin election is definitely not happening, but I still want to oppose the first election after the renewal RfC running across two calendar months because it will spawn needless debate over whether the five-month timer is meant to go start-to-start or from the end of the prior election to the start of the next one. This upcoming election should be within a calendar month to set an expectation that the next one will occur in the fifth calendar month after. ViridianPenguinüêß (üí¨) 00:27, 16 May 2025 (UTC)
A thought: if we design this election cycle to not conflict with the same month as ACE, it'll end up conflicting some time in the future because of the odd # of months. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 19:13, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Obviously, my thinking was just that it would be better to not conflict when AELECT is still a relatively new process. When it's established and routine, there should be fewer potential issues. If my maths is correct (and it might not be) if we delay this two weeks from the above suggested dates then the first clash will be the thirteenth election rather than the second and by that time any bugs in processes will likely have been ironed out, many unknown unknowns will have made themself known, we'll have experience of dealing with them and people will be familiar with both types of election. Thryduulf (talk) 19:25, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Yes, that's what I said ("eventually the problem will be encountered again"). All I'm saying is we can defer worrying about this until the arbitration committee election RfC is over and the dates are known. There is enough flexibility in the administrator election process to allow for adjustments. isaacl (talk) 21:05, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Election clerks will be needed before the start of the voting period in order to complete preparations and setup, particularly for the first time an election is run on the English Wikipedia server. Personally I think we'd want clerks and scrutineers in place before the call for candidates, and even the poll initially created (though not finalized for voting), so all resources are ready to run through the election process. isaacl (talk) 17:17, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Whichever date we set, we could put out a request for election clerks and scrutineers say a week ahead of time. I agree it would be preferable to have volunteers and the poll in place ahead of the call for candidates, even if not strictly required. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 18:27, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Fine by me. I take it the secure poll setup phase was for the trail only? fanfanboy (blocktalk) 18:22, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Yes, it was more complicated then because it required the WMF to help set it up - in addition, because the suffrage requirements were complicated, a whitelist of eligible voters had to be manually generated and fed into SecurePoll. Neither should be true for future elections. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 18:26, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
I would be in favor of doing some localhost and enwiki test elections. During that testing I will write a work instruction, and that will shorten the SecurePoll setup phase, but probably won't eliminate it. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 19:14, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
I personally think this might be too early to schedule this. We do not have SecurePoll installed and working on en.wikipedia. Queuing up an election before we are 100% certain we can actually run it on that date is not a good idea, and puts undue pressure on us. We don't know if more software patches are required, and we haven't got a concrete decision on several key implementation details (eg. encryption) BugGhost ü¶óüëª 18:29, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
We certainly don't have to finalize any dates until those things have been taken care of, but it's good to start discussing it. From my understanding WMF has signed off and the technical changes will be implementable quite quickly. June is still a full month away. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 19:10, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
True, but it's worth remembering that the last RFC about AELECT ended up taking nearly 2 months to run its course. I agree with Novem that a June election isn't completely unrealistic and hopefully we'll be able to get it all working by that point, I'm just worried that we have several unknowns to deal with before we can be certain. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 01:46, 3 May 2025 (UTC)
It might be a bit early to pick dates. I have a sequential todo list that is something like 1) deploy config patch, 2) create the 3 MediaWiki pages and update the 3 documentation pages mentioned in Wikipedia:Administrator elections/SecurePoll permissions proposal, 3) ask WT:AELECT who the electionclerk(s) should be, 4) do a test election on localhost wiki, 5) do a test election on enwiki, 6) recruit 3 scrutineer volunteers from among the CheckUsers. Once that is complete, I think that'd be a good time to set the exact dates for the next election (because at that point it will have no blockers remaining). I do think June is realistic but I am not sure we should commit to exact dates yet. Hope that makes sense. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 19:11, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
Sounds reasonable. As mentioned above there's definitely no need to finalize anything until we're all set. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 19:24, 2 May 2025 (UTC)
phab:T378287 is probably blocked for another week on a security ticket. WMF is making good progress on the ticket and is on like step 4 of 5. The idea is they want to patch the security bugs before deploying SecurePoll more widely.
Revised estimate for next election is July or August. The gap in time is to allow some time for discussions of details, practicing with test polls, picking electionclerks and scrutineers, things like that. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 01:01, 16 May 2025 (UTC)
Update: the security ticket is on step 5 of 5. Should be unblocked in a week or so, and then will need another week to deploy enwiki config changes. Once that's done, we won't be reliant on anything outside our control, and we can pick dates for the election. The election dates will probably be around 1-2 months out from the unblocked/ready date, to give plenty of time to prepare. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 22:41, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/c/operations/mediawiki-config/+/1083870 is scheduled for backport. Once the backport is done, everything else will become unblocked, and we can move on to the next step, which is me doing test polls in localhost and on enwiki and writing work instructions for how to be an election clerk. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 22:36, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Agreed, great work from @Novem Linguae and others! ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 18:12, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Update: The next administrator election will very likely be in July. Let me do a test poll on my local computer, then a test poll on English Wikipedia using some volunteer test voters. I'll use that to write a work instruction for election clerks and gain confidence that we won't mess up the actual poll. Then once that's complete, let's set the dates. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 00:14, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

What are our current thoughts on who the election clerk(s) for the next election should be?
As a reminder, these are the technical folks who set up the poll, hold the encryption key, configure the eligible voter criteria, things like that. This role is not able to see any confidential data like IP addresses (unless they are also a checkuser). The 3 scrutineers that we pick will also be de facto election clerks (they'll have access to everything an election clerk does) but I do not envision election clerking being the scrutineer's main role.
I'd like to propose myself as the next poll's election clerk. Happy to follow the community's lead though. If selected for this role, I plan to load up SecurePoll on my localhost wiki and set up a test election there, then write a thorough work instruction on how to do it. Then create an enwiki test election and have a couple volunteers vote, and refine the work instruction. Then do it for real the third time. Writing a good work instruction will help someone else be able to take over this role in the future, and practicing a couple times will make sure that the election clerk is experienced enough to avoid something like messing up an encryption key or a voter eligibility configuration during the real poll. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 01:10, 16 May 2025 (UTC)

I believe the best way to handle this is by a simple notified discussion on this page. I believe it's best you are election clerk for this election, but will prefer a neutral discussion, just in case. Something as simple as "Who will election clerk for next election" and allow anyone to discuss options. And then crosspost the same/notify the same on WP:RFA and two three other pertinent venues.
Basically I'd like to dot all Ts and crossed all Is, even when I believe you're the best option for facilitating this election. Soni (talk)  05:25, 16 May 2025 (UTC)
While I am a bit hesitant to bother noticeboards about AELECT stuff yet again (I feel like I'm asking for their input on the small details of AELECT perhaps a little more than I should), there's been very little participation in this section, so we might have to. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 17:43, 17 May 2025 (UTC)
You being the election clerk makes the most sense, as there isn't documentation yet. ‚ÄîFemke üê¶ (talk) 18:22, 17 May 2025 (UTC)
The noticeboards see "There is a pertinent discussion at X place about Y" all the time. It doesn't have to be fancy or all over the place, as long as we inform the main places it would be fine Soni (talk)  19:01, 17 May 2025 (UTC)
Novem is a very good choice for being an election clerk for this election. I think we would need at least one more just for redundancy and to increase our bus factor a bit. BugGhost ü¶óüëª 07:05, 18 May 2025 (UTC)
I can be a backup clerk if need be. ‚Äì robertsky (talk) 10:36, 20 May 2025 (UTC)
Likewise, though I suspect admin clerks only might be a better solution for the time being. Soni (talk)  11:32, 20 May 2025 (UTC)
Robertsky is an admin. By the way, what do we envision the second clerk doing exactly? Technically the second clerk is actually the 5th clerk because the scrutineers are also election clerks. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 14:58, 20 May 2025 (UTC)
Mainly just for redundancy, for example having a copy of the encryption key in case the "primary" election clerk goes missing, and to double check config etc before the election goes live. I agree it's not the most essential role but at the moment having one person responsible for the setup is a single-point-of-failure. I'm happy with any of the scrutineers volunteering to act as an election clerk - I know they technically will have the user right either way, but I assumed scrutineers would be added to the poll after it was configured, and only carry out their roles after the ballot closed. (If people think having extra election clerks is unhelpful I'm happy to back down on this.) BugGhost ü¶óüëª 16:26, 20 May 2025 (UTC)
As I stated earlier, I think there should be at least one backup election clerk who is not a scrutineer with whom the encryption key is shared, so they can trigger a vote tally if necessary. isaacl (talk) 21:26, 20 May 2025 (UTC)
Sounds good to me. Sounds like through discussion this proposal has crystallized as me as lead election clerk and Robertsky as election clerk #2, and the idea is to share the encryption key between both of us. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 00:37, 21 May 2025 (UTC)

FWIW I'm happy to serve as a clerk or to test anything/be a test dummy. Giraffer (talk) 11:04, 21 May 2025 (UTC)
Also happy to be an election clerk in support of Novem & Robert as needed, or just as backup. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 15:52, 21 May 2025 (UTC)

I suspect the same, but I'll be happy to help as well (especially on the techy side of things) Sohom (talk) 14:07, 22 May 2025 (UTC)
I marked myself as the main election clerk and Robertsky as the backup election clerk for now. Diff. Thank you to everyone who volunteered. If something happens and more election clerk volunteers are needed, we will be sure to reach out to the folks that volunteered here. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 22:29, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
It looks like our local page says that election clerks should only be added to administrators, however there appears to be one non-administrator in the list. ‚Äî xaosflux Talk 18:54, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Turns out that was temporary and had to do with publishing the patch - I asked @SD0001 about it on their talk. ‚ÄîGanesha811 (talk) 20:37, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
I can attest to the fact that DreamRimmer was indeed involved in deploying the patch. While technically out of process, it is fine since to my understanding the right was only used to test if a admin was able to make a grant. (which was what the patch was for). Sohom (talk) 20:40, 10 June 2025 (UTC)

Hello page watchers. Are any of you English Wikipedia CheckUsers that would like to scrutineer the next election in July or August? Looking for 3 English Wikipedia CheckUsers to volunteer. Will start by asking on this talk page, and will post more widely if we need more people.
A steward might be OK too, but we'd need to ask ArbCom if they're willing to grant temporary English Wikipedia CheckUser to facilitate this. Last election I think ArbCom did this but felt a bit surprised and pressured, so this time around we'd need to ask them early and wait for their approval. ‚ÄìNovem Linguae (talk) 01:16, 16 May 2025 (UTC)

We have a pretty large pool of CUs, so I'd wait and see if you get volunteers before getting ArbCom to make special appointments again. I'll post to the list and see if anyone is interested. Primefac (talk) 13:20, 17 May 2025 (UTC)
I'm expecting to have a lot of time by then, so I'd be interested in volunteering as a scrutineer. beef [talk] 13:25, 17 May 2025 (UTC)
If needed, I can help. I would be a bit busier, but probably would have space to do it. Would defer to others if there are other volunteers. Dreamy Jazz talk to me | my contributions 14:23, 17 May 2025 (UTC)
I've been pretty much out of the CU game lately, so I'll be happy to pitch in with the scrutinizing (scrutinization? scrutineering?) if you need me.  Now that we've spun up AELECT for real, we really should aim to be self-sufficient and not have to impose on the stewards. RoySmith (talk) 15:27, 17 May 2025 (UTC)

I can likely serve as an alternate as well. Best, Barkeep49 (talk) 02:04, 19 May 2025 (UTC)
I think a good time to ask this in the future would be when there is a date set for the election, to ask specifically for CUs who can be available at the scheduled end time ("00:00, 32 July 2025 (UTC)") to start checking. I imagine that many candidates will be eager (as was I) to get the result as soon as possible. ‚Äì JensonSL (SilverLocust) 05:01, 20 May 2025 (UTC)
+1 To that. Making the process as painless as possible means making it as short as possible (suspense is not fun). Obviously, that shouldn't come at the expense of allowing for scrutiny of the candidates, but ensuring the CUs we choose will be available to scrutinize the votes in an expeditious manner is an easy win.And before anyone goes there: Being an admin is hard, but "letting candidates feel a taste of hardship" is not kind to the people going through the process. I've been an admin for almost a year, and I have experienced nothing on Wikipedia even coming close to the stress of RfA; my activities in that time included clerking WP:PIA5. HouseBlaster (talk ‚Ä¢ he/they) 23:42, 21 May 2025 (UTC)
It may be useful to have some standing documentation on scrutineering. Instructions are available for arbcom elections 2010 - 2024 and maybe other places. WMF elections also have an adequate description page. I guess if securepoll is going to be used more often for other things, a generalised page might make more sense, with specific criteria listed in each election page. -- zzuuzz (talk) 09:51, 23 May 2025 (UTC)
For my part, I'm mostly interested in the community expectations for what justifies a check.  My experience is mostly at SPI, where cases are brought with behavioral history which informs a CUs decision to check or not.  We won't have that when scrutinizing an election, so guidance along those lines would be a good thing. RoySmith (talk) 11:16, 23 May 2025 (UTC)
