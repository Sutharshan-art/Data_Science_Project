Hi everyone,
I would like some community feedback on the continued relevance of the article on Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe as a transnational political alliance -- note that this is different from the article on ALDE as a European political party or as a political group of the European Parliament, or as a political group of PACE, or in the Committee of the Regions.
The page is not really developed and has not changed much in a while. Meanwhile, I am not really sure that this "alliance" between ALDE Party and the EDP is still a thing, and the EDP's website does not seem to mention it at all. The number of seats in the EP is also wrong and the website is actually that of ALDE Party. At the very least, if we are to keep this page, it should probably be in the past tense. What do you think? Julius Schwarz (talk) 08:28, 28 May 2025 (UTC)

Any input, anyone? If not, I would really move ahead and change this to the past tense. Julius Schwarz (talk) 07:44, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

I cleaned up the worst of this. This was the before. Apparently she (or one of her employees) put in a bunch of weasel words and spam links. She is a potential candidate for the 2026 United States Senate election in Iowa. Can somebody further clean up this article? Bearian (talk) 02:43, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
