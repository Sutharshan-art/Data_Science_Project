In article two of the decree issued by Lasso on 5/17/23 it says "notify the NEC to call elections within a period of seven days" - would this mean that they're supposed to have a snap election in seven days, or does the NEC have seven days to start planning them? Castroonthemoon (talk) 19:03, 17 May 2023 (UTC)

My understanding is the NEC has seven days to set a date for the election, which must be no later than the following 90 days. See BBC Mundo which gives some deadlines. But it's all a bit vague, uncharted waters: I saw one source claiming the deadline was 180 days (but maybe that included the 2nd round, if needed?). Moscow Mule (talk) 00:47, 18 May 2023 (UTC)

Declared candidates table should be changed.
The current one is being used as President-VP nominee table on US Election Pages. 2002:7987:844E:0:0:0:7987:844E (talk) 16:56, 19 May 2023 (UTC)

Please check the version of the article in the Spanish Wikipedia and you'll see a more dynamic use of the citations and elaboration of the list. I know, it's an exception of the rule. However, managing the page based of the information of what politicians thought before the snap elections, it's pointless at least for me. I'll make some changes and feel free to discuss them.

Aquella es una SPA, bloqueada de la Wikipedia en espa√±ol por manipular los datos de las encuestas. Trata de manipular los datos aqu√≠ tambi√©n. Nuestra funci√≥n aqu√≠ es publicar los datos, mas no interpretarlos, lo que est√° haciendo este usuario. -- David C. S. (talk) 22:49, 10 July 2023 (UTC)
The actual layout of the Presidencial Pools Section of the English Ediction page of the 2023 Ecuador General Elections , revised by Dirceu Mag is the correct one , the David C. S. versions are inacurate and , indeed , misleading.
Comparing the two versions , and reviewing midia Reference Notes in quotations, at this moment, from 1 to 52 , concerning the ones related to the table of Presidencial Pools , I list below the following uncongruencies related to David C. S. edictions :
1. The 5-6 Comunicaliza Pool to candidate Bolivar Amijos is coted on Reference number 40 as having vote intention of 0,1% and not 0, 5% as stated by David C.S.
2. David  C. S. erased the full research period of all cited Pools  ,leaving only the last reserch day , without explaining the reasons behind this action.The full research period is available in each note attached to any mentioned Pool ,there is no clear reasons to omite then,unless unfathomable ones.
3. I placed in the second column the candidate that scored the second highest percentage of votes in the most recent Pool, Comunicaliza,held on 6-7 July : Otto Sonnenholzner(12,8%).
David C. S. permutate the order of the columns,situating Yaku (10,3%) in second place.
4. I placed the candidate Jan Topiƒá (3%) in the seventh column.behind Bolivar Amijos (0,1%) and on front of the sixth on percentage points,Daniel Noboa (4,5%).
David C S. also permutated the natural order of columns,placing Daniel Noboa in the 7th position and Jan Topiƒá in the 6th column.
5.In the last two weeks,since the first Pool have been published on 22 June, David C. S is heavily indulging in the game of trunking columns...!
The candidates Yaku P√©rez and ,in particular, Jan Topiƒá had  their moments of glory, however , they have been brief and flashy.
On 'Data Encuesta' Yaku got second place and Topiƒá, third place and also,more astonishingly,got second in intention of vote diretly from the 7th position .on Mercanalis Pool,from 2% to 14% !
When it did happened,David C S. perverted the temporal sequence and permutated the order of columns both in the horizontal and vertical ones.
Insted of ordering the vertical  percentage columns from top to bottom, according to the horizontal temporal order , he reversed the sequence of events.  doing it from botton to the top : the candidate that got the higher percentage on the older Pool gain precedence on the vertical columns over the candidate that got a higher percentage rate in a more recent Pool.
He succed in placing Yaku P√©rez aways in second place and , to make it easier , placed a 'bold' tipo [reserved to the candidate that achieved 2nd place ] on '8%', in the 6/22-26 'Negocios & Estrategias' Pool.
In fact , on this Pool,Yaku P√©rez got 10/8 % and Otto 11/8 % , they are not tied.
The 8% on bold tipo is just a visual pretest to make it more acetable putting Yaku P√©rez in the 2nd column in spite of the two most recent Pools placing Otto Sonnenholzner in second place.
David C. S. , also ,tried hard to place Jan Topic in the third  column.
Displacing  Jan Topiƒá from the correct 7th column and apart from Bolivar Amijos that has 0% ,can help distort the public perception about the discrepancies between the Oficial Pools and the ones that  bestows the highest percentage points to Yaku & Topiƒá and avoid the occurrence of something that David C S. dislikes most : wiki readers objective reasoning and clear,truthful interpretation  of events.
6. David C. S. erases completely the column of published [Facebook] 'America Elects' calculation of the valid votes [blancs and void abstracted] .
Most blatantly,just like a vandal , he don't say a single word justifying the reasoning behind this action , in particular.
Doing a lot of mischifs all together,in a bulk, make it easy not having of justify any of these wrongs in particular,  it is not necessary being specific, giving explanations ,  going into details... , something that David C S. ,also, much dislikes.
7."Data Encuestas",the Pollster David C.S. respects most,the one he certainly will never kick off, again and again, as he have done with 'America Elects',on the contrary. bestows the Laurels of Victory , is a bizarre enterprise as he, himself.
The Reference Section [note 41] contain a link to the Facebook page of Diario Opini√≥n , posted on 22 June 23:59 , on which is
stated that the full research date of the Pool is 5-9June 2023.
The Pool gives Luisa Gonz√°lez 27,8% , Yaku P√©rez (14,8%) in a close tie with Jan Topiƒá (14,3%).
The Wikipedia page on Luisa Gonz√°lez states in the Political Career Section , Subsection 2023 Presidencial Campaign, that "Luisa Gonz√°lez was proclaimed on 10 June 2022 as Presidencial Candidade for the Revoluci√≥n Ciudadana after Jorge Glas declined his candidacy".
This event couldn't be known beforehand so , it is , therefore.  proved that no real Pool could have been done between 5 and 9 June including the name of Luisa Gonz√°lez as Oficial Candidate of Revoluci√≥n Ciudadana.
The "Data Encuesta",from Diario Opini√≥n,is , therefore, just a scam to promote de candidacy of Yaku & Topiƒá !
David C. S. , displicently and familiarly, requested the librarian Ruy to ban me from editing Wikipedia Spanish Language for a period of "infinitely",without even bothering to justify , giving one or two examples of wrongdoing from my part , pinpoint unacuracies as would be normally expected.
He was ,promptly,successful in his request , nevertheless,  no one can hide truths "infinitely" or tell lies undefinitely.

I have been blocked/unblocked from editing the Wiki by Librarian 'Number 57'.
I was working on Ecuador General Elections 2023/Polls Section, which have been, viciously, vandalised by David C. S.
After being, also, blocked on the Spanish Language Wiki by Librarian RUY, under the spell of David C. S. and ,briefly, unblocked, by request of 'Number 57' and then, blocked once again, by the same Librarian Ruy, that appears to be acting in CONIVANCE with a real SPA!
Each one of my corrections have been fully JUSTIFIED on the EDICT HISTORY Notes of the Ecuadorian 2023 Election Page":
See the 11 consecutive Notes 
written on 18 July from 8:18 up to 14:46.
Since then.  David C. S. also, committed other misedicting acts, such as deleting the America Elects calculation, based on Negocios % Estrategias Poll, that gives Luisa Gonz√°lez 52% of Valid votes [ discounted the Blank and Null ones].
During the brief period that I have being unblocked on the Spanish Ediction, I had  opportunity, only, of deleting the blatantly fraudulent insertion by David C. S. of your fabricated "Pool" dated July 3.
I wrore a explanatory note to the Spanish Wiki's 'Edict Section' of 'Ellecciones Presidenciales de Ecuador 2023' on July 18 / 7:57.
Immediately afterwards,  Librarian RUY, locked the entire 'Ellecciones de Ecuador 2023' Page, allowing David C  S. procceed on force-feeding  his already PROVEN FRAUDULENT EDITION, without being questioned!
This matter needs, urgently, CHECK AND INVESTIGATION by others Librarians and Burocrats!

Request for unblocking of i.p.and user may username .   üö´ unjustified: no edicting including falsely stated data have been made. 
The editor David C. S., that made the request about banning me, was the one that, actually, introduced misleading information  on Ecuador General Elections 2023 Electoral Polls Section. 
He was banned from the English Language Ediction, but is still very active on the Spanish one.
Dirceu Mag Dirceu Mag (talk) 15:02, 1 August 2023 (UTC)

Each one of my Ediction insertions, on Ecuador General Elections Electoral Polls Sections, have been fully justified on the Page History of July 18 , on 11 consecutive notes [please check].
David C. S. wagged a Ediction war on the English ahd Spanish Electoral Polls Section, deleting , again and again, anything that I had inserted, without pin pointing what I have done that he understood as unaccurate. 
He, then, reiterated his own versions, that have been proven false.
He, furthermore, complained to admistrators, saying that the page have been attacked by a SPA, without exemplifying,    being specific, on any, misleading, published data, actually proving that my account was a SPA, to justify his request.

√Ä propos: est√° permitido que una agrupaci√≥n pol√≠tica o una alianza, reemplace a un candidato si es que este fallece ... antes de las respectivas elecciones ("a party/alliance whose candidate dies before the election can replace him/her").
