The 2025 Greater Lincolnshire mayoral election was held on 1 May 2025 to elect the inaugural mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, on the same day as other local elections across the country.
Andrea Jenkyns of Reform UK won the election with 42% of the vote, from a turnout of 29.9%.


== Background ==

The election covers the entire historic and ceremonial county of Lincolnshire, which is governed by three councils: Lincolnshire County Council, North Lincolnshire Council, and North East Lincolnshire Council. Those councils will remain in place, with some powers being transferred to the new mayor.


== Electoral system ==
The election used the voting system of first past the post to elect the mayor. In this system the candidate with the most votes wins, even if they do not win an overall majority of the vote share. The Electoral Reform Society described the move towards first past the post as one lowering the bar for politicians and thus damaging British democracy.


== Candidates ==
Several individuals either publicly expressed interest or had media speculation about the possibility of them running:
