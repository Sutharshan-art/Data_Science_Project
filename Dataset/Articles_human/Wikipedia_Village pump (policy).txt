Starting this thread as a spin-off from WP:BN (permalink). At the very least, I think that twoeither one or both of these things need to happen: 

Exclude gaming inactivity or inactivity as a valid criterion for using the newly established recall process.
Align current inactivity standards to what the wider community expects of "active" administrators.
I believe both of these are required for a more constructive recall process, such that eventually the question if someone has gamed the process does not need to arise. qedk (t 愛 c) 12:49, 25 May 2025 (UTC) (edited on 18:21, 28 May 2025)

Words cannot express how strongly I oppose the first half of this, qedk, at least as applies to gaming. Are you actually, with a straight face, proposing that we amend the procedure meant to hold admins accountable for violating policies, in order to exempt violations of a policy we routinely block non-admins for violating? I'd strongly encourage any other admins to consider what supporting that would convey about whether they support holding admins to the same standard as non-admins.  Forbidding petitions based only on inactivity without a gaming element... meh. Let's worry about that if it ever happens. Upping inactivity rules, sure. Put me down in support of anything more strict than the status quo. But it absolutely should not be paired with amnesty for admins who violate a specific policy.  -- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|🤷) 12:59, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I am, with a straight face, saying that. The community should align expectations from admins and make it sufficiently clear such that the question if someone is gaming does not need to be a problem that the community needs to solve. It's a waste of the community's time and energy that is better spent elsewhere. I also do not appreciate the comparison to the other actually disruptive applications of gaming the system (a guideline) - that is a strawman argument that is not at all pertinent to the problem we're seeking to solve. --qedk (t 愛 c) 13:13, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
If your proposal is based on the idea that admins  making de minimis edits to evade the inactivity rules for years, as they drift farther and farther out of touch with community norms, is not disruptive, then I think that's a better rebbutal to the proposal than anything I can say.  -- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|🤷) 13:45, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
The incorrect assumption being made here is that just because they're inactive (or gaming the system, which is not ethical to be clear), they're unaware of community norms. No one is perfect, and like every other editor, it's also unfair to expect admins to be subject to assumptions of gaming and non-awareness of community norms. Similarly, inactivity itself can be due to a multitude of reasons, we don't care about why they are away but what we should care about is - what level of inactivity is unacceptable from a currently standing admin - such that, we're sure that they are not aware of present-day community norms? --qedk (t 愛 c) 17:19, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I would argue that an admin that does nothing, by definition, can't be disrupting anything.  If that admin then does something bad/wrong, whether due to being out of touch with the rules or otherwise, then that would be disruptive, yes.  Or if the admin's account got hacked, that would be disruptive, too.  Or people bringing up conversation about that admin (via recall or otherwise), then that person is causing a disruption about the admin, but the admin didn't cause the disruption.  A number of disruptive things can stem from the admin's inactivity, sure, but the inactivity itself cannot be a disruption.  Useight (talk) 16:46, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Recall is, almost per definition, a process that says "they aren't breaking the rules, we just don't have enough trust in them to be sure they're not going to break them in the future." Therefore, there's no need to exclude gaming activity. If 20 people think they're gaming, they can either resign or re-RFA. If 20 people don't think they're just gaming, they're good. (And I'm speaking as someone who has gone through an attempted recall.) And if someone files against everyone who's just cleared the requirements, that's disruptive and sanctionable. --SarekOfVulcan (talk) 17:52, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
I get your point but that process was hardly similar or relevant to the discussion here. --qedk (t 愛 c) 12:15, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Fiddling with various thresholds to trying to have rules that can't be gamed doesn't seem worthwhile to me; it reminds me of the adage about how trying to make something foolproof just leads to the universe inventing a bigger fool. If you make the requirements stricter, that just increases the incentive for people to game it.As to the counterproposal of having the rules say "no gaming", meh, discussion will still be needed to determine whether there's actually gaming or not. Since we already have Wikipedia:Administrator recall, why would it be better to hold discussions over whether an admin is gaming or not at WP:BN instead of there? Do we trust 'crats to do a better job than whatever mob shows up at the recall petition? If so, then perhaps the recall process needs to be revisited as a whole instead of trying to make carve-outs. Anomie⚔ 13:22, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
There are problems with administrator recall, as I've expressed in multiple discussions about it in various fora, but this is not the way to solve them.
What the admin activity requirements should be is a separate question. I don't think there is a way of avoiding thresholds completely but they are evidently not quite aligned with what the community desires, which is for admins to remain engaged with the project and to keep in touch with evolving policies and norms. If we want to continue measuring this by edit count (which is easy to measure but imperfectly reliable) then something closer to the following might work:
Admins are expected to demonstrate that they remain in touch with the community. Ideally admins should be making multiple non-trivial edits or logged actions most months, but must average at least 10 edits or logged actions every six months over a two year period. Administrators who consistently fall below this activity level or who attempt to game the requirements may be subject to recall no sooner than three months after being alerted.
Administrators will be procedurally desysopped if they fail to make at least one edit or logged action in any 12 month period or 100 edits in any five-year period. 
Administrators who appear to be gaming activity requirements and/or who appear to have not kept up to date with policies or community norms may be subject to recall no sooner than three months after being alerted (this does not preclude recall petitions being initiated over other matters, including egregiously bad departures from contemporary community norms). 
This is explicitly not a proposal at this stage but an idea presented for feedback. Thryduulf (talk) 15:31, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
On a personal level, if I correctly understand your proposal that admins...must average 10 edits or logged actions every six months over a two year period, and it had been in force in the past, I would have been forced out on more than one occasion, and yet I do not feel that I have ever lost touch with policies and community norms. Now, I am not a particularly active admin, although, to my continuing surprise, the number of my logged actions is in the middle range of all admins, and losing the bit would merely free my time up a bit, I cannot support such a strict rule. Donald Albury 16:10, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I would prefer not to speculate on admin motivations by using "game" (as I suggested on the admin recall talk page). I think it's sufficient to discuss considerations of ongoing familiarity with current community guidance and standard practices. isaacl (talk) 16:12, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
As I stated on the admin recall talk page, I do think the community should have a discussion on the expectations on admin activity. I feel the community wants its admins to have some ongoing connection with the community, and uses recent edits as a metric to determine this. It's imperfect, but I think it's a reasonable approach, with corner cases able to be handled separately. I also made a suggestion in that same discussion that one possible approach is to shift the emphasis to no-fault removal of administrative privileges to reduce the scope for security vulnerabilities, with the current restoration process available for admins to regain their privileges. This would help smooth the way for a much higher activity threshold, which can better satisfy community expectations. isaacl (talk) 16:07, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I think we need to step back and figure out what we're trying to accomplish here, because the best solution depends more on the root goal than the intermediate one of "desysop inactive admins".  Some possibilities:
Are we trying to improve security, by minimizing the chances that a compromise of a long-inactive administrator account will go unnoticed by its owner?
Then the initial system of zero edits in a year was the right answer all along.  If that proved insufficient - say, there were multiple compromises of minimally-active admins that were used to slant content, as opposed to the usual "Hey, I've just deleted the main page and blocked Jimbo, obviously I need to be blocked" - then the proper refinement is to shorten the time period, not to introduce a longer-term one like our current 100 edits/5-year rule.
Are we trying to ensure each admin is still using their bit to benefit the encyclopedia?
Then you measure inactivity by the number of logged actions in mainspace only, with the understanding that admins who are close to the threshold will be flagged for manual review, and clearly-frivolous actions like creating a page just so you can immediately speedy it as G7 don't qualify.
Do we want to show that every admin maintains the community's confidence?
Then the most direct way is to periodically run every admin through the recall process, or skip it and go directly to re-RFAs.  {{Deityname}} have mercy on the souls of the first few dozen.
Is it most important that whatever inactivity rule we have is hard to game?
Then solely basing it on a hard limit of some sort is a bad idea, because any hard limit, no matter how absurd, can be gamed.  Grade on a curve on instead: three or four times a year, find the 1% or 5% or 10% or whatever admins who've been the least active by whatever measure - edit count or logged actions or support percentage in reRFAs or whatever - and desysop those.  Maybe combine with a moderately-absurd hard limit on the order of 100 edits per month to protect us from the "best" case where even that would fall into the lowest 1%.
—Cryptic 16:25, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I am reminded of the old Microsoft rule that the bottom 5% (or whatever it was) of productive programmers were routinely sacked to go work for Boeing.
Having said that, it's an egregious rule (like so much early Microsoft thinking - we can argue 'early'), especially for a volunteer project. And I do note that becoming an admin these days is actually quite hard - the RfA process these days is pretty rigorous. It wasn't always so - WP has changed a lot.
So maybe you have a review process, say a 5-year review. No hard bright lines, just consensus that x is still a productive admin, broadly construed. It could even be a peer review - admins agreeing on admins rather than making it open to all editors. As a non-admin, I'd support that, TBH... Best Alexandermcnabb (talk) 17:06, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
(edit conflict) The problem with a temporary tenure before was that RfA was atrocious and it would be unfair to subject editors to it more than once. I think with elections, that alleviates the issue, if we make elections more frequent, I do not think that's a bad idea. This would also make adminship not a big deal as it was originally intended. --qedk (t 愛 c) 17:25, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I like Alexander's idea of peer review.
(Microsoft was not the most aggressive at weeding out low performers; other companies did larger percentages.  At one company, if you were the bottom 10% of the chosen metrics two quarters in a row for your own team, then you were fired – even if the reason for that is that the rest of your team was the top performers in the whole company, and you were above average compared to the whole company, or even if the low performance was due to temporary reasons.) WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:19, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Re your 3rd point, Cryptic, in a perfect world I'd like to see proper admin reconfirmations here. Nothing heavyweight, something like a straw poll where the two options are "reconfirm" and "send to re-RfA", max 50 words' rationale per user, 50% to pass. But I don't expect that to happen anytime soon, so, re your 4th point, I think the easiest solution is to create a discretionary zone, just like we have at RfA and with resysop activity. This could address both inactivity-gaming and the loophole that allowed Gimmetrow to be resysopped in the first place. Something like, Bureaucrats may at their discretion deny resysop if they feel the requester would not have met the WP:RESYSOP criteria but for actions taken solely for de minimis compliance with those criteria. Similarly, bureaucrats may at their discretion include an administrator in the monthly inactivity desysop list if they feel that the administrator would meet the criteria for an inactivity desysop but for such actions. The resysop procedures for such an ex-administrator are the same as for any other administrator desysopped for inactivity. In an eventuality where bureaucrats have such power, I would be okay with inactivity-gaming being exempt from RECALL, although I wouldn't support the idea either.  -- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|🤷) 17:23, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
A few thoughts:
I don't want a minority who want a stricter admin activity threshold than community consensus supports to be able to do an end-run around consensus by recalling admins who are likely too disengaged to desire running a new RRFA promptly.  I don't think the two most recent recalls are a problem, but I do want caution.
I don't think our current admin activity policy is significantly misaligned, but I do wish that crats used discretion more aggressively for any account just skirting the exact fringes of our brightline policy.  A good analogy is edit warring versus the 3 revert rule - our inactivity policy is the analogue of the 3RR as a brightline where if you cross it you are almost certainly edit warring/inactive, and we can take action in most cases accordingly.  However, you absolutely can edit war while staying within the letter of the 3RR, and you absolutely can be more inactive than the community is willing to tolerate while staying inside the letter of the inactivity policy.
I dislike the idea of carving out reasons why an admin explicitly may not be recalled, which feels inelegant.
Perhaps a good solution for less active admins would be to apply the "grace thresholds" to the next RRFA/admin election they run in, even if it falls outside the 1 month window.  The tools would still be removed after a month.  That way, an admin recalled in this way would be able to return to activity, make a number of edits to show that they are in touch with community norms, and then make a compelling case for getting the bit back on their schedule.
Tazerdadog (talk) 18:04, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I agree with Tazerdadog:  I don't want a minority who want a stricter admin activity threshold than community consensus supports to be able to do an end-run around consensus.  It's not fair for the community to say, out of one side of our mouth, "Here's the minimum acceptable level of activity" and then out of the other side of our mouth, to say "By the way, 'only' meeting the minimum is unacceptable".  That's gaming the recall system, to allege that someone is gaming the activity standards.
If we want to have higher activity standards, then we need to have a higher activity standard.  It's not okay to have a consensus that one edit per year is enough, and then have two dozen individuals say "That's nice, but we are enforcing a higher standard, and we don't have to have a consensus for our higher standard". WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:23, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
I disagree with the premise that the current activity requirements are out of sync with community expectations. The cases that have made their way to successful recalls were based on pretty clear gaming and unmet promises to return to activity. Enforcement of inactivity requirements is better handled through bureaucrats. Recall is a poor fit for this type of policy enforcement because it's a heavyweight community process and it adds unnecessary delays to resolve what should be a narrow and factual question. I think it's also extremely unlikely for any re-RFA to be successful in cases of inactivity so it's just a bad fit in every respect.
I think Tamzin's proposal for a discretionary zone would also enhance the bureaucrats' ability to handle these exceptional cases quickly and fairly, specifically by allowing bureaucrats to desysop in cases where activity barely meets the technical threshold but clearly falls short in substance. A discretionary zone also allows for bureaucrats to consider evidence of activity that may not be visible in the logs.
Finally, it might help to add a requirement that administrators being resysopped after a period of low activity (e.g., less than 1,000 edits or actions in the previous two years) must meet a somewhat higher threshold to retain their tools (perhaps 1,000 edits and 100 actions in the following year). This also seems like something appropriately handled by bureaucrats. Daniel Quinlan (talk) 18:27, 25 May 2025 (UTC)
I would agree with the above views that the recent "inactivity" RECALLs were more accurately "gaming" and "communication" (in different ways) recalls. Neither demonstrated a clear community desire to move inactivity requirements, and even less so raise any great ideas about what new requirements could be. As for excluding admins from guidelines/policies, that seems the opposite direction to what the RECALLs wanted, which is admins in touch with community expectations. CMD (talk) 01:54, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
I don't see the purpose of this. The recalls occurred because of a clear end run around existing rules. The rules don't need to be changed just because someone tried to get around them. Community action when someone is end-running around edit warring, as another example, is more than sufficient to deal with the problem rather than trying to make edit warring policy more extensive. Similarly, the recall process has worked perfectly as a community action system for someone end-running around the inactivity rules (and other admin problems re prior recall cases). Recall is already an existing method to deal with such edge cases and has worked perfectly well so far. I see no reason to change inactivity rules at this time. And I certainly see no need to alter recall rules until we actually have examples of inappropriate cases going through, which hasn't occurred even a single time thus far. SilverserenC 02:20, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
That is exactly the point of concern. Gaming is not a bright-line policy that we can apply to inactivity because it's inherently impossible to figure out the actual situation that these real people are in and even whether if someone's actual intention is to game the system. When we talk about people not being allowed to game the system we should first and foremost be talking about disincentivizing gaming rather than punishing people who we think are gaming the system. If it was true that the current numbers are aligned with our inactivity standards, why do we care so much that they're gaming to exactly keep their rights? Is it true that they engaged in misconduct or showed that they were somehow out of touch with community norms? The answer is a resounding no. As I said before, the current example is one of recency bias where there is certain validity to the claims of gaming - but when we use for-cause processes to conduct processes that effectively sidestep procedural policy, it's only a question of when, rather than if, things will go wrong. --qedk (t 愛 c) 08:44, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
Gaming is not a bright-line policy that we can apply to inactivity it's never possible to know for certain that somebody's intent is to game the system in any situation. Admin activity is not special there. That's not even a particularly unusual feature in terms of Wikipedian practice: people are routinely blocked as WP:NOTHERE or WP:VANDAL despite the fact that we don't actually know their intent for sure; similarly it's not unusual to see blocks for edit warring even when everyone involved stays on the right side of the bright-line WP:3RR. The fact that GAMING is not a bright-line policy means that we cannot automatically apply it, but if you think that we cannot realistically apply GAMING at all the solution is to abolish the policy entirely, not just say that admins don't have to follow it. No wonder people think the Super Mario effect is a problem. Caeciliusinhorto (talk) 18:36, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
This may not be very helpful, but I looked at some data regarding how many accounts are (even possibly) out of line with community standards and have or could have admin flags. 1) I assume that the activity of the 438 accounts at Wikipedia:List of administrators/Active is not in question. 2) There are 307 semi-active admin accounts. Some of these could be making minimal edits, but they would eventually hit the 100-edit/5-year cutoff in that case. 3) There are 94 inactive admin accounts. Changing the standards for these would really only matter if they actually lose their flags for inactivity and then ask for them back. 4) There are about 200 former admin accounts that were desysopped in the last five years due to inactivity or resignation (not "for cause" or other reasons that would make the account ineligible for re-sysopping) and haven't hit the logged action rule. Of these, Wikipedia:Former administrators/reason/resigned#Active and Wikipedia:Former administrators/reason/inactive#Active seem to indicate there are 78 (58+20) active accounts that would normally be eligible for re-sysopping after a hold to review the case. That leaves the list at Wikipedia:Former administrators/reason/inactive#Admins desysopped due to having made fewer than 100 edits in five years (criterion 2), who would need to establish a return to activity, a list of 123 accounts. If that's the list we are considering, then there is no ongoing risk of damage and a relatively small number of accounts that would be the target of any new rule; it seems like a case-by-case evaluation is possible since few of them are likely to ever ask for the tools back. If we are really trying to redefine inactivity to encompass more of the 307 semi-active and 94 inactive admin accounts, then I wonder what evidence there is of an actual problem under the current standards. How many of those 401 admin accounts are actually out of line with community standards and unable to be taken care of eventually under the current inactivity rules? (Open to correction on any classifications I've gotten incorrect here.) Dekimasuよ! 06:08, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
I should clarify that even proposals that are adjacent or in opposition to what I think are quite doable - it's community consensus after-all. Currently, I see three (most of which are disagreed to mine, some agreement on BN, but whatever):
Tamzin's suggestion to allow crats to determine gaming - and have them determine if they should resysop. Theoretically, we can also extend resysop periods beyond 24 hours to allow for community input - this serves similar to recall with lesser requirement of community input but crats make the final call.
Thryduulf's suggestion of strengthening the criteria and enshrine not gaming as part of inactivity rules.
28bytes' suggestion (from BN) to simply enshrine gaming inactivity rules as part of the recall process.
I think I am somewhat aligned with the first two. --qedk (t 愛 c) 08:44, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
24 hours is already just a minimum. NaomiAmethyst's resysop request, which fell into the narrow discretionary zone that already exists on resysops, took over a week, including substantial community input and a 59-hour 'crat chat.  -- Tamzin[cetacean needed] (they|xe|🤷) 08:58, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
I think it's a middling example of how it could be. I suspect it can be made more procedural like a crat chat, so the community aspect is more reserved. --qedk (t 愛 c) 14:33, 26 May 2025 (UTC)
This is conceptually wrong.  The whole point of things like Admin Recall is precisely to handle vague situations like gaming.  The system worked fine, there's no need to change anything, other than perhaps convincing people that the system doing what it was intended to do is not some accidental slip-up.  Inactivity rules are in place for a good reason.  Enforcing them is a good thing, not a bad thing.  The recall process worked and was "constructive" in this case.  As edit count is a very weak signal, the standards are intentionally on the low side so as to avoid ensnaring innocent bystanders (e.g. still active admins but who are mostly active on other Wikimedia projects or other languages).  Things like recall cover the case where the edit count is overstating their contribution, rather than understating it, because the 100 edits were all of an irrelevant "fixed a typo" kind.  Or, put another way: the hard limits should be lenient.  But that doesn't mean the subjective limit is lenient.  This is, again, good practice, and not a mistake, but an intentional choice.  SnowFire (talk) 16:33, 27 May 2025 (UTC)
And that's exactly why it's a bad idea. You create a rule - and then you provide a backdoor around the rule that does subsumes exactly what the rule was supposed to be for in the first place. How would we expect inactive or semi-active admins to automatically figure out what our soft limits are, is that not an utterly unrealistic expectation per se? --qedk (t 愛 c) 07:33, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
No, it is not unrealistic for admins to stay in touch with community expectations. There's also no backdoor here, the hard limits are triggers for automatic deadminship, no more, and they are certainly not a target to aim for. CMD (talk) 08:53, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
I think we need to discuss what "stay in touch with community expectations" means. There are various adminny areas that I do not work in, so I have no idea what community expectations are in these areas. (So if I choose to do some work in those areas I will lurk first and try to find out what community expectations are). To fully understand what community expectations about admin candidates and admin behaviour is in general, one needs to spend quite a bit of time at places like RFA, village pump, ANI. These unwritten expectations (often about things that have nothing to do with the use of admin tools) can be hard to keep up with. I find it unreasonable to expect familiarity with all of this from people going through phases of low activity. Overall, we should remember that we do not have a functioning process for making new admins at the moment, so semi-active, inactive and former admins are our main source of future active admins. Why do we try so hard to make them unwelcome? —Kusma (talk) 13:05, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Re QEDK: Nothing is unrealistic here.  This isn't rocket science.  All of the recalls-for-inactivity so far have been the kind where the inactivity was inarguable and obvious, and that the only conceivable argument against the recalls is "I disagree inactivity should be a criterion for de-adminship" (which, well, sure, but just say that then).  Any attempted recalls on more arguable cases aren't likely to start to begin with, and aren't likely to succeed if they do.
Or, and feel free to correct me if I misinterpreted you: you phrase it as "create a rule."  But 100 edits per 5 years isn't the operative concern; inactivity is the concern.  100 edits per 5 years is just the extreme level where the process becomes automatic because there's no argument otherwise.  Everywhere else has wiggle room, which is good not bad to repeat, that means we're using human judgment rather than gameable rules.  Just 200 edits but is caught up doing tech work and MediaWiki patch requests?  Sure, no problem.  200 edits but they're substantial ones including admin work?  No problem.  200 edits that are fixed a typo or editing their own user talk page to avoid automatic de-adminship?  That's still inactive.  Anyway, don't take it from me, ask someone you trust in real life, but change the domain and don't say which side you're on.  e.g. is it acceptable for the aviation club to revoke admin-level access from some guy who just checks into the hangar for 2 minutes twice a year and does nothing but is over the bare minimum standard for automatic revocation.  SnowFire (talk) 13:49, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Okay, so you do understand me then? If an aviation club says you have to check in once a year to not have your access revoked and you do, they will literally abide by that expectation. It literally doesn't matter to them if you stay for 2 minutes or an hour. --qedk (t 愛 c) 18:29, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Please humor me and ask a friend, without cueing them what answer you "want" to hear.  My expectation is that they will say that the letter of the requirements was met, but not the spirit, and the spirit is what's important, and the aviation club would be well-justified in revoking access anyway.  It's certainly what Wikipedia does elsewhere (again, Extended Confirmed the most obvious example, it is not just a raw "any 500 edits, our hands are tied").  SnowFire (talk) 18:59, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
What? You want me to hypothesize but when I disagree with your hypothesis - I have to ask a friend (who I guess will have to agree with you)? Also what does gaming EC have anything to do with the actual points of discussion here? What if someone makes 500 pointless (non-disruptive) edits and then edits constructively? They should get blocked? What if they make 250 pointless edits? Or 50? Anyway, I don't that that's relevant and I'd prefer if you'd stick to the actual issues being discussed here instead of bringing up very slightly adjacent applications of gaming that very clearly do not apply here. --qedk (t 愛 c) 08:50, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
Are two inactivity recalls too many inactivity recalls, such that the rules should be modified to reduce the number of inactivity recalls? Levivich (talk) 17:21, 27 May 2025 (UTC)
No, but two recalls in the span of a month both related to inactivity instead of actual conduct issues is too many. --qedk (t 愛 c)
I've seen only a few situations where it became a problem; in both cases it was incompetence.  Probably a combination of the lower bar from "got in back when it was easy" combined with inactivity.  Ironically, these both because problems when they did something.  Ironically, those with zero activity do no harm. On one the incompetent one was given the bit back out of courtesy with just a simple request. How about raise the bar a bit and when and when an inactive admin runs into it the need to make a self-assessment statement that they feel that are current enough to do do the job properly in which case it gets waived? North8000 (talk) 18:24, 27 May 2025 (UTC)
I propose the opposite: add a mention to WP:INACTIVITY that these standards exist because we expect inactive admins to hand in their tools, and that doing the bare minimum to keep admin tools may be seen as gaming the system to subvert these expectations. Thebiguglyalien (talk) 🛸 19:20, 27 May 2025 (UTC)
I think if the community wants inactive admins to relinquish administrative privileges, then the most straightforward approach is to just remove the privileges, rather than say the community might decide to remove the privileges at some point. isaacl (talk) 00:29, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
That's what WP:INACTIVITY is. The problem is that we have people cheating the system so they don't get the removal when they're supposed to. The solution is to say that they still get the removal if it's determined that they're cheating the system. Thebiguglyalien (talk) 🛸 00:45, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
You're suggesting to add a mention that inactive admins are expected to relinquish administrative privileges, without defining the level of activity when that expectation starts. I'm saying the community should discuss if its expectations on when administrative privileges should be removed matches the current removal procedure, and if not, then change the criteria so they do. There are reasonable security concerns for doing so, and I don't feel it's a good idea to set up a sword of Damocles. If the community wants to make removal (and restoration when activity resumes) a normal occurrence, with no fault attached, it should just do it, and skip having a discussion about whether or not a particular case should be considered insincere. isaacl (talk) 01:05, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Exactly. --qedk (t 愛 c) 07:33, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
We have done this. If an admin comes back within 3 years of their last edit they can simply request restoration with no fault attached. CMD (talk) 08:56, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Unless they get recalled you mean, which is also exactly the problem we're talking about. Nothing simple about it. --qedk (t 愛 c) 10:30, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
It sounds like the problem you refer to is that consensus can change, in which case I suppose there is no way around it and nothing simple as that's a building block of Wikipedia. However, it is not particularly or uniquely relevant to the point at hand, and I assume that on average admins are more aware of WP:CCC than most editors. CMD (talk) 11:13, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
That is an absurd reduction of what I'm trying to say. What we're doing is basically drawing a line in the sand, pointing admins that way and then saying "welp! there's actually an invisible line you didn't know about (because we didn't tell you), sorry!" and showing them out the door. --qedk (t 愛 c) 11:40, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
This is exactly how edit warring works. You can comply with 3RR or even 1RR and still be blocked for edit warring. No one is promising that editors who comply with 3RR won't be blocked for edit warring. The rule isn't "don't cross 3RR," the rule is "don't edit war." Similarly, you can comply with inactivity requirements and still be recalled for inactivity. The rule is "be active." Also, unlike edit warring blocks, a desysop is not showing an admin out the door. Levivich (talk) 11:58, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Indeed it is not a particularly unique issue, and admins are expected to be familiar with this concept, which is covered by our guidelines. CMD (talk) 14:04, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
This is not "exactly how edit warring works" - editwarring, 3RR and 1RR are all very explicit that editwarring is not (just) a bright line issue. Admin inactivity, prior to the recent recalls, has been an explicitly bright line issue. When admins have become out of touch through inactivity they have been brought before ANI/Arbcom/Recall for the disruption their being out of touch has caused, not for being inactive. Thryduulf (talk) 16:51, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Prior to very recently, there was no community process for removing administrators! 173.79.19.248 (talk) 14:55, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Indeed, and so removals were restricted to situations where there was actual demonstrated harm. Nobody has articulated what harm someone minimally active but not misusing the tools is actually causing. Thryduulf (talk) 15:15, 30 May 2025 (UTC)

We have (mostly) not had a discussion yet about whether or not the community's expectations on inactivty matches the current criteria. (The discussion has been mostly about whether we should have a discussion.) We are not encouraging admins to request the restoration of administrative privileges by having a recall discussion using terms that bring their sincerity into doubt when removing privileges. If there is a community consensus for a much higher level of ongoing activity, then let's put it into effect without any recall discussion to trigger removal. isaacl (talk) 17:22, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
@Thebiguglyalien, why do you say above that meeting the actual, consensus-determined, written standard is "cheating"?   WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:38, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
I assume it's for the same reason we WP:PGAME exists. We pull permissions all the time for gaming them with trivial edits, and admins should be held to a higher standard. ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 18:40, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Exactly. I wouldn't have an issue with it if someone wanted to add admin inactivity gaming to the list of examples at WP:PGAME. Thebiguglyalien (talk) 🛸 21:14, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
So you think that we should treat making occasional edits – just not as many edits as some people want – as being the same as "Making unconstructive or trivial edits"?  PGAME has a numbered list, but that's the only item in the whole section. WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:42, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
If an occasional edit (singular) is made just in the nick of time to avoid a desysop, yes, they are defeating the spirit of the rule, which is exactly what WP:GAME is about. You can hand in the tools temporarily if life is getting in the way, and that's not a bad thing. Every single reminder admins are sent gives them the instructions to avoid making token edits to keep the tools and gives a link to BN to resign if needed. HouseBlaster (talk • he/they) 03:03, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
What we're doing is basically drawing a line in the sand, pointing admins that way and then saying "welp! there's actually an invisible line you didn't know about (because we didn't tell you), sorry!" and showing them out the door: Yes, we are, and that's a feature, not a bug. The entire point of the inactivity requirements is that we shouldn't need to tell admins about "invisible lines" (read: community norms). They should already be familiar with those lines, because they're active in the community, and if they're not, they should turn in their adminship. If someone is gaming the deliberately low bar to keep their admin status, that feels like a perfect use case for recall. I don't see what problem any of this is trying to solve. Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 14:22, 28 May 2025 (UTC)

I've been trying to think of how to phrase my thoughts on this, and Writ Keeper nailed it. ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 14:46, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Except we're changing the rules on them without telling them. We've spent the past quite a few years now telling admins that "being active in the community" means making at least N edits in (period of time). Now we are saying that's not true and "being active in the community" means doing that and a bunch of nebulous other things that are undefined and unknowable but if you don't do them someone will recall you. If you happen not to be paying attention to Wikipedia during a particular 24-hour period (if you're lucky) you could be out on your ear before you even know anybody is upset at you not doing something you didn't know you were meant to be doing. Thryduulf (talk) 15:26, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Is that what has happened? Or have admins that have clearly gamed the activity requirements been recalled? WP:GAME has been a guideline long enough that it can legally vote in a couple months, so I don't think the community enforcing it is sudden or unexpected. The only difference is now the community has a path to address activity gaming by admins. ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 15:43, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Also, what we actually tell admins, in {{inactive admin}} and {{inactive admin 2}}, is: Inactive administrators are encouraged to rejoin the project in earnest rather than to make token edits to avoid loss of administrative permissions. So even if we accept your silly premise that admins must be spoon-fed their standards and expectations like a five-year-old, we are already doing that in this case. Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 15:46, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
It's not a silly premise at all and I absolutely reject the bad faith associated with your comment, both towards me and towards those admins who are maintaining activity according the explicit standards we set for them. If we want to change those standards, that's fine, but what is not fine is pretending that we are doing something other than changing the standards and holding people to those standards before they have been changed. Thryduulf (talk) 16:04, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Nah, I don't think you're in bad faith, I just think you're being silly. We at least nominally elect admins based on their cluefulness, which implies--perhaps even is defined by--the ability to read and apply these "unwritten rules" of community norms. If admins needed everything spelled out for them, then we could just replace RfA with a basic reading comprehension test. After all, it's not like the concept of "the written rule is a deliberately low bar that doesn't define the minimum acceptable behavior" is a foreign concept on Wikipedia; several others have already pointed out 3RR as an example. If we can't expect admins to pick up on both the community's feelings and the strong hints in the notification templates about activity, why do we expect non-admins to grasp the nuances of edit-warring beyond the bright-line 3RR? Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 16:19, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Those unwritten rules would be fine in theory if they didn't directly contradict the written rules. 3RR and edit warring are both explicit that edit warring isn't (just) a bright line issue. The activity reminders say that you should be engaged with the community - which is what the written rules say meeting the activity requirements is. Thryduulf (talk) 16:37, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
It doesn't, though. WP:INACTIVITY defines the threshold at which one is subject to procedural desysopping due to inactivity. It doesn't define what the meaning of "engaged with the community" vs. "inactive" is. (Nor should it, because such a definition would never be agreed upon by everyone--which is why we now have a community process in admin recall to handle it on a case-by-case basis, rather than a semi-automated process to decide it). Nowhere in there does it say "an active admin is considered to be..."  or "an inactive admin is one that hasn't...". Which, again, shouldn't matter regardless, because we expect admins to be able to grasp the spirit of a rule without being slavishly devoted to the letter of a rule. Like,  there's also no rule that explicitly says I shouldn't blank Jimbo's user page and replace it with a wikilink to Bomis Babe--he outright welcomes people to edit his page, and it's not a non-sequitur or anything. But I don't, because "reading the room" is a skill we expect admins to possess, and that applies here just as much as anywhere else. Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 16:57, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
(de-indent, re Thryduulf above) What would it take to convince you that, even if you disagree as a matter of preference, that there is no "contradiction" here?  Inactivity has always been a matter of human judgment.  You can argue that it shouldn't be, but right now it is, and that's what the community wants.  We want a system that can be easy on an admin with a low edit count but who is obviously active, and be harsh on an admin who made 1,000 edits to user page essays or something in the past 5 years and nothing else.  If you disagree that's fine, but that's different from claiming that the standard was unclear.  It's not unclear, it's just that the standard isn't 100% down to raw edit count.  The exact same issue comes up with gaming extended confirmed status via pointless edits. It's not controversial that not all 500 edits are created alike, and the solution to accounts gaming the extended-confirmed requirements is not to increase the threshold to 1000 edits, but to have Actual Humans look at those 500 edits and say "hey, 497 of these were to a Sandbox page." SnowFire (talk) 17:08, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Inactivity has always been a matter of human judgment except that is not what our admin inactivity policy says. I'm saying that the inactivity policy should match the community's expectations about inactivity. The recent recall demonstrate that there is currently a mismatch between what (some) members of the community expect and what the policy expects. That is the contradiction I do not wish to see continue: Either we change the inactivity policy to match the expectations or we change the expectations to match the policy. Thryduulf (talk) 20:26, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
By "our admin inactivity policy", do you mean the automatic desysopping threshold?  Because that is not the "admin inactivity policy" (see the various analogies to 3RR vs. the policy on edit warring).  To go back to my question - are you saying that you'd be satisfied by some sort of footnote on the 100/5 rule saying "this is the threshold that triggers automatic desysopping, it is not the sole expectation on admin activity, WP:Gaming the system applies to admins too"?  This doesn't think very highly of admins if so that they need such a disclaimer...  and as noted elsewhere the inactivity templates already encourage either a handing in of tools or a genuine return to activity rather than pro forma edits....  but maybe I'm misreading you.  SnowFire (talk) 20:47, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Once again meeting the explicit requirements in the policy and gaming are not the same thing and I will not be happy until they stop being incorrectly conflated. Thryduulf (talk) 20:51, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
I once again ask: What would it take to convince you that you're wrong?  That the community does not see the 100/5 threshold as synonymous with "the policy" and that the GAMING criteria is intended to apply to admins just as much as EC-gamers?  Because if this is impossible, then no "clarification" is required, that's just you refusing to understand the reality of the situation.  (And I will again say that disagreeing with the community is fine, I have my own areas I think the community is Big Wrong on.  But just admit that you disagree with the community then, rather than saying the matter is unclear.)  SnowFire (talk) 22:34, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
What it would take to convince me that the written rules are the actual rules is to get consensus for changing the written rules.
For example, if you can get INACTIVITY changed to say something like "Admins can be desysopped for inactivity based on the subjective and even arbitrary view of whoever is doing the desysopping.  If it gets so bad that they don't make even 1 edit per year, then the desysopping will be automatic, but noticeably higher activities are explicitly not a protection against desysopping for inactivity", then I'll agree that this view is the community's consensus, and not the work of a tiny percentage of editors trying to GAME their way around the written policy. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:42, 30 May 2025 (UTC)

That strawman is about beaten to chaff at this point. This issue is WP:PGAME, not the requirements themselves. ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 16:45, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Firstly it's not a straw man, and I'm far from the only person who disagrees with you about whether following the rules as written is or is not gaming those rules. Please stop trying to characterise it otherwise. Thryduulf (talk) 16:48, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
"because some people think the ones with consensus aren't strict enough." is a strawman though. People aren't starting recalls for every admin who just exceeded those minimum requirements, only for those who actually game things by e.g. making false promises which result in a positive crat chat. We have a panic among some people after nearly every recall procedure it seems, but so far none of the succesful recalls have been shown to have been done incorrectly (recalling an admin who still had the support of the community, or a recall done by some coordinated cabal). Neither the inactivity requirements nor the recall requirements need adjusting, or at least for neither has such a need been demonstrated. Fram (talk) 17:19, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
To Fram's point, while you've made it quite clear that you think the inactivity requirements can't be meaningfully gamed, here are 25 to 50 users that disagree with you. Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 17:23, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
And so what? We don't know if they gamed requirements, we don't know if it was something they faced in real life - they are just going to leave and that's it. There is literally no net benefit apart from removing admins who we think to a reasonable degree have probably gamed our inactivity guidelines. In terms of community effort and time consumed, it's literally a net negative. --qedk (t 愛 c) 18:19, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
If it looks like a duck, acts like a duck, quacks like a duck, and makes blocks well outside of community norms less than an hour before being desysopped with the effect of evading the 5-year rule like a duck, I think it's more than reasonable to give the community a chance to call it a duck through the recall process, as they did. I still don't see the problem. Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 19:50, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
We almost never know when it comes to gaming... Yet we have a strong understanding that removing editors who engage in consistent or egregious gaming is a net positive for the project and I don't see how it would be any different when the editor doing the gaming was an admin. The gaming admin is lucky to only get a recall and not a community ban for gaming (if they will game that system what system won't they game?) Horse Eye's Back (talk) 15:49, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
Recall that past discussions on setting activity standards had difficulty in setting them higher because there wasn't a consensus among the participants that admins must be continuously active to continue to be trusted to hold administrative privileges. I don't agree with some of the sentiments expressed that admins must be sufficiently aware that community sentiment has shifted. First, without a broader RfC, discussion is limited to a very narrow, self-selected segment of the editing population, which typically is more likely to have participants who have issues with the status quo. Second, I don't think it's reasonable to expect all admins to be assiduously tracking all discussions across the many forums where people like to discuss these matters.
I understand why some editors think ongoing activity is important for admins (connection to the community, ongoing exposure to current best practices, guidance, and norms, monitoring for accounts being accessed by others, and so forth). But past consensus has also felt that the volunteer aspect of the role must be balanced against this. I think it would be best for the community to definitively establish in a request for comments discussion if there has been a change in how the community weighs the tradeoffs. isaacl (talk) 17:38, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
The proposal of the OP is to exclude admins from following WP:GAMING. Changing inactivity thresholds does not affect this proposal, as gaming can happen for any set of guidelines. CMD (talk) 17:42, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
The proposal of the OP is not that important, the goal is to workshop ideas. I agree that gaming can apply to any guideline, I disagree with the supposition that inactivity guidelines being gamed is a concern and posit that admins should have the right to clearly understand what the community expects of them instead of being subjected to arbitrary recalls. The primary problem is that accusing anyone of gaming is an accusation of bad faith and there is no reasonable separation between someone who has gamed and someone who has simply failed to meet community expectations. That's the crux of the matter. --qedk (t 愛 c) 18:19, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
If "accusing anyone of gaming is an accusation of bad faith", why seek to carve out an exemption specifically for admins instead of seeking a change that will affect everyone? CMD (talk) 18:31, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
What kind of a strawman is this? How is it at all a carve-out for admins? I'm explicitly stating (asking for, in fact) that community expectations should be codified into our policy. I'm literally advocating for more stringent expectations - so that - admins have clear expectations of their tenure, it's literally that easy. The reason that accusing someone of "gaming" is an accusation of bad faith is that any accusation of something negative is an accusation of bad faith, it's like if I right now, posited that you have vandalized the wiki - until proven, it's an accusation that is of bad faith. That is the key difference, you cannot prove that someone has gamed by simply being inactive. There is no way to tell the difference between admins making enough edits with the intent keep their rights and admins with the intent of improving the wiki but who have not been able to put in as much effort as they would like. --qedk (t 愛 c) 18:49, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Tamzin explained how in the very first reply of this thread. The first bullet point is an explicit carve out. It's very strange for you to call it a strawman so far down the thread. As for the rest, that still doesn't explain why such lenience should be applied to admins but not others. CMD (talk) 19:54, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Just because someone disagrees with you does not make their argument a strawman. Just because a couple of people think something is a strawman does not necessarily make it so. QEDK has repeatedly engaged in good faith with those who disagree with them, it would be good if you could extend them the same courtesy. Thryduulf (talk) 20:28, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
@Thryduulf why are you directing this at me? QEKD is the one who called my observation a strawman. What courtesy have I not extended, and does that apply to what I said as well? CMD (talk) 02:25, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
Thryduulf just following up on your statement regarding courtesy. If it is relevant, the first use of "strawman" is in the third comment of the thread. CMD (talk) 01:16, 30 May 2025 (UTC)

Surely you cannot change the premise of the question and not expect me try to bring it to actually pertinent points of discussion - such that this process remains constructive. --qedk (t 愛 c) 08:50, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
I am not sure what this is replying to, or what premise I am supposedly changing. The proposal is clearly written "Exclude gaming inactivity or inactivity as a valid criterion". As Tamzin said, this would "exempt violations of a policy we routinely block non-admins for violating". CMD (talk) 09:04, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
Fine, let's clarify how then. The initial premise I set was to ask the community for opinions on how we can avoid the recall process being used for determining subjective interpretations of gaming and align community expectations with actual policy such that the recall process does not need to be utilized at all. Your first comment mentioned that any guideline can be gamed and I agreed to some degree and explained exactly why particularly applying gaming here is a pointless and altogether a net negative for the wiki. You then proceeded to pick exactly one statement I made, changed the context and replied with why should our policy have a carve-out for admins when clearly that is not at all what was ever being suggested (which again I proceeded to explain in detail how not). Your third reply again goes to ignore what I've tried to convey, refers me to Tamzin's comment (who also I have engaged with extensively), does not answer any of the questions I've raised and just refers to it as a carve-out again. This is not constructive and I will respectfully disengage. --qedk (t 愛 c) 09:21, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
I have not changed any context. Your explanations have all referred to gaming in general, which is why it is odd that they translate specifically into excluding the application to admin activity. (It also doesn't detail with the specific aspects of both cases at hand, which in different ways demonstrated quite clear issues.) I'm not sure what questions you have raised, but if you want the proposal to not be a carve-out, you should probably propose a new option that does not in plain text create an explicit carve-out. CMD (talk) 09:35, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
Admins don't have rights, they serve at the community's pleasure. Thebiguglyalien (talk) 🛸 18:41, 28 May 2025 (UTC)

Any hard rule (on any topic, not just in Wikipedia) with clear lines is subject to gaming.

The particular case of administrator activity on Wikipedia is not special or interesting in this regard. 173.79.19.248 (talk) 15:02, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
WP:GAME is a codified expectation which reflects the community viewpoint correctly, are you suggesting that admins be removed from its guidance? Horse Eye's Back (talk) 15:32, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Not an admin, and this discussion definitely doesn't incline me towards pursuing "the bit" but I try to stay up to date on community norms here and I'm struggling to comprehend what is the harm either side is trying to prevent here. As far as I can tell:
Long ago, the community established activity thresholds below which admins automatically get de-admined.
Some admins responded to this by a pattern of editing just enough to remain above the activity threshold.
Recently, the community established an recall process by which admins whose conduct is questioned by a sufficient number of users can be required to repeat the RFA or election process again to retain their bit.
On two recent occasions, this recall process was used to accuse admins like those mentioned in (2) of gaming the system, leading to their removal as admins.
???
I understand the benefit of timing out enhanced privileges in cases where we can't be confident the account is still under control of the original trusted user to reduce our attack surface from compromised accounts. In the case of the admins above, I fail to see how their retention or removal affects the project at all. It seems like any possible benefit in either direction has already been counteracted by the amount of wasted bytes in this discussion that could have gone towards content creation. We already expect admins (and experienced editors) to understand an incredibly complex set of norms and cultural context, and we already have fewer admins (and fewer editors) than would be good for the health of the project.
TLDR: the questions burning in my mind are:
How is the Wiki better now that the bit has been removed from those marginally-active editors?
How would the Wiki be better if those editors had retained the bit?
From what I've seen so far, it seems like initiating recalls on low-activity admins and trying to construct ungameable activity thresholds are both a huge waste of time, whose most tangible effect is likely to be a reduction in the willingness of people to consider taking up the admin mantle.  -- LWG talk 20:48, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
These are very good points. An admin can only harm the project by taking actions. An inactive admin is not taking actions. Thryduulf (talk) 20:55, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Moreover, if the object of the policy is to avoid hijacking of inactive accounts and admins out of touch with current policies, then the admin who does the minimum to retain the bit ("gaming") is no threat either. Hawkeye7 (discuss) 23:02, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Mostly concur. --qedk (t 愛 c) 08:50, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
I don't know that it would help with the problems that some participants here are describing, but we could add a footnote to the inactivity section that notes that some admins have been recalled for activity that just barely exceeds the threshold of procedural desysopping. We could just state that fact and let readers take from it what they will, or we could explicitly say something like what we already say in the inactivity notice templates ("Inactive administrators are encouraged to rejoin the project in earnest rather than to make token edits to avoid loss of administrative permissions"). I'm hoping a footnote is a decent compromise between those who want admins to have more of a heads up and those who think there is no problem here. In general, as we start to rack up more recalls, I do think it's worthwhile to review our policies and procedures to harmonize them with community expectation. I don't think we should base major changes on a sample size as small as the one we have now, but tweaks/adjustments/footnotes/clarifications might be appropriate.

I think I could get behind that change. "Sure, you can make one action per year if you want, but if you get a recall petition filed on you, don't be surprised." --SarekOfVulcan (talk) 13:03, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
I think there is some consensus (from this discussion here) that gaming is a valid criterion and as such we should codify it into WP:RECALL and WP:INACTIVITY as a valid criterion (the first one being the community can recall you and the second one being crats can refuse to give your rights back). At the very least, it will disincentivize admins from attempting to game the system - and on the flipside, make them learn how to game better, which is an unfortunate outcome. --qedk (t 愛 c) 12:15, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Admins having to learn to game better is a better outcome than exclud[ing] gaming inactivity or inactivity as a valid criterion for using the newly established recall process. One of them improves behavior, the other lets misbehavior slide. ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 12:28, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
How so? I thought this entire exercise was to prevent them from gaming the system, which we think is very wrong. --qedk (t 愛 c) 12:30, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
At some point gaming better becomes acceptable editing. That's something that has come up a number of times with EC gaming in ARBPIA. ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 12:34, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Now that's just absurd, because that is exactly what I (and a few others) were proposing to fix by codifying community expectations into policy instead of doing it the other way around. --qedk (t 愛 c) 12:36, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
(edit conflict) @ScottishFinnishRadish Do you really believe that incentivising gaming that is harder to detect is a good outcome? That that is a better outcome than eliminating the mismatch between the explicit requirements and community expectations such that gaming is no longer a thing at all? I certainly don't. Thryduulf (talk) 12:33, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
I think there's a word for harder to detect inactivity. Activi-something-or-other, maybe? ScottishFinnishRadish (talk) 12:35, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
This whole discussion exists because what some community members define as minimally-acceptable activity and what policies define as minimally-acceptable activity do not match. The way to fix that is to find what the community consensus regarding minimally-acceptable activity actually is (which may or may not be what some particularly vocal individuals want it to be) and then change the policies to match that consensus and to prohibit recalling administrators for meeting those requirements but not unwritten ones that don't have consensus. The way to fix the disconnect is not to replace it with a different disconnect between written and unwritten rules. Thryduulf (talk) 12:46, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Your perception that “you will be de-sysopped if you do not maintain activity above level X” is a definition of a minimum acceptable activity level is wrong.  It is a definition of a maximum unambiguously unacceptable activity level (where “unambiguous” means “can be enforced automatically, without a further consensus-based process.”)
Almost certainly there is no true consensus about what a minimum acceptable activity level that could be expressed as an automatically enforceable rule; moreover, any attempt to clearly write down such a thing would *also* be subject to gaming. 173.79.19.248 (talk) 11:38, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
Thanks IP, this is a very good phrasing. -- asilvering (talk) 17:15, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
I don't mind your proposed language, but I'd slightly prefer not to explicitly use the word "gaming", since there's debate here over whether bare-minimum activity box-checking is gaming or not. My preference is based on likelihood in getting consensus here, not on which language might be better. Firefangledfeathers (talk / contribs) 15:44, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
I can understand that people are worried about a slippery slope here, but the two who have been recalled were both called out for the gaming well in advance of the recall petitions. I don't think it's fair to summarize this as "we tell admins there's a rule, and then desysop them anyway when they adhere to it". I'd be alarmed if that's what was happening. But it hasn't been. -- asilvering (talk) 14:59, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
I would support adding a piece about gaming to the inactivity requirements, per SFR. We don't need higher requirements - we need admins to abide by the spirit of the rule, rather than the letter, as with all policies. We block editors who make a fourth revert after 24 hours and 1 minute. We pull the EC flag from editors who make 500 rapid-fire sandbox edits. This is no different, and talk of secret unwritten rules is off the mark. Vanamonde93 (talk) 16:28, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Yes, but in the case of the 24:01 fourth revert, it's the second revert that started the edit war, not the fourth.  You were already 'guilty' before you reached the fourth revert.  And EC is supposed to make 500 'real' edits, not run an unapproved bot for 500 edits.  Everything the edit warrior and the sandbox bot were doing is wrong.
In contrast, "the spirit of the rule" for INACTIVITY doesn't say that admins are doing anything wrong by averaging one edit every 2.5 weeks (i.e., 100 edits/5 years), even if those edits tend to be bursty (e.g., 100 edits this year, 1 edit next year).
I do think there is value in retaining old admins merely because they're from an older time period.  I think there are times when we need someone to remind us of our older standards, or to be the last person who remembers why a bot was configured a particular way, or to be disconnected from internal politics.  But what irritates me here is that we haven't been able to get consensus to say in INACTIVITY that this is all vague and subjective and following the written standard is a de-sysop-worthy violation of the gaming guideline, and yet we still have a minority enforcing the rule that they can't (yet) get adopted as real. WhatamIdoing (talk) 18:58, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Can ex-admins not remind us of our older standards, or be the last person who remembers why a bot was configured a particular way? Assuming there's no Men in Black-style memory erasure with the desysop that I'm unaware of. REAL_MOUSE_IRL talk 22:56, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Can ex-admins not remind us of our older standards... not when you've bullied them all off the project for following the rules. Thryduulf (talk) 23:03, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
That's basically the problem.  We could enforce an unwritten rule on "accounts", but that doesn't mean that the humans will continue feeling good will towards the project afterwards.
Imagine that you're having a horrible real-life situation.  Like "family member dying of cancer" or "deployed to a war zone" bad.  Imagine that it's long.
Do you think that when you finally have time for Wikipedia again, that you'll be feeling welcomed and supported by a community that says "How dare you only make a couple of edits each year for a couple of years in a row!  They're obviously just trying to exploit our systems for their own benefit.  ('Cause you know that being an admin here is a really valuable benefit to the user.)  Let's de-sysop them while they're not looking!"?
I don't think people would return under those circumstances.  Do you?
If we wanted to do something like this, then a statement that compliance with the rules isn't enough really needs to be in the written rules, and it needs to be there long enough for admins to notice its existence (e.g., two years, based on my experience with other policy and guideline work). WhatamIdoing (talk) 01:55, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
Nobody is asking for any kind of new enforcement. What I believe is that we should not restrict the community's ability to use the recall process. That's pretty much it. If the community wants to initiate recalls against admins that appear to be gaming the inactivity criteria, that's their prerogative. Writ Keeper ⚇♔ 03:37, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
I really think we should acknowledge more that low activity and "legacy" admins are (a) humans who have put years of their life into this project and (b) potentially helpful. Too much of the narrative is that they are a problem that needs to be managed. —Kusma (talk) 07:50, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
That narrative exists because there have been numerous kerfuffles that occur when an admin not familiar with community standards takes an action that proves significantly controversial. Inactivity policies help lesson the chances of that, and those kerfuffles have actually occurred and have caused way more poor feelings than the hypotheticals imagined above. Further on the narrative, this focus on two recalls does not help it. There have been successful requests for readminship following deadminship due to inactivity. I don't have the numbers but I assume more than 2 didn't lead to a later recall, and that should be a considered part of the discussion around inactivity guidelines and policy. CMD (talk) 08:01, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
That is not at all pertinent to our current discussion. If this is a serious point you are trying to make, you should clarify how many of these kerfuffles were due to admins who were apparently gaming our inactivity policy. Otherwise, it simply does not apply to the matter at hand. qedk (t 愛 c) 08:15, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
It was a reply to Kusma's comment, and entirely pertinent. CMD (talk) 13:15, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
As you have done repeatedly, you have changed the premise of the situation itself to suit your point. That is the opposite of pertinent. How does your arbitrary kerfuffles that literally does not concern our discussion of admin inactivity criterion factor in? You seem to be saying that it's primarily caused by admins out of touch with community expectations who remained in power by gaming the system; and yet you have offered zero evidence to back that view up. qedk (t 愛 c) 13:57, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
How do issues that arise following long periods of inactivity have nothing to do with inactivity? Please don't say I'm changing a premise and then make up an odd view and attribute it to me. CMD (talk) 15:59, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
What odd view? You have given nothing to substantiate your argument - the onus of your claim is on you and no one else. You're also doing the exact same thing in the thread below with Thryduulf, which is just incredibly unhelpful. You have a fundamental misunderstanding as to where primarily the disputes on this wiki stem from and if you think they're due to semi-active or inactive admins, you're gravely mistaken. If you're not willing to discuss this constructively, then I have no interest in engaging any further, sorry. qedk (t 愛 c) 00:33, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
The odd view you directly wrote in the comment above. Plenty of people have engaged with you constructively throughout this thread, you have called their comments strawmen, something that Thryduulf noted was somewhat incivil above. Now you claim "You have a fundamental misunderstanding as to where primarily the disputes on this wiki stem", which, I have no idea how such a grand claim can even be extrapolated from this quite topic-limited discussion, nor how that can come in the same comment as a straight faced request "to discuss this constructively". CMD (talk) 17:02, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
That narrative exists because there have been numerous kerfuffles that occur when an admin not familiar with community standards takes an action that proves significantly controversial. So the problem is admins who take actions, not admins who don't.
Inactivity policies help lesson the chances of that Do you have any evidence for this? Thryduulf (talk) 10:00, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
Hi Thryduulf, are you going to look over your comment on courtesy above? CMD (talk) 13:16, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
I have now done so, so would you like to respond to my points? Thryduulf (talk) 15:34, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
The problem is admins who take actions after a long period of not taking actions, yes. The evidence is therefore in that very situation which has happened multiple times. CMD (talk) 16:00, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
How helpful can someone be if they only show up and edit here when access to their tools are at risk? ~~ Jessintime (talk) 14:02, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
More helpful than somebody who doesn't show up at all because they've been firmly told that they aren't welcome. Thryduulf (talk) 15:33, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
Most likely helpful enough to still be a net positive to the wiki. What are the negatives to letting them continue to minimally contribute? CMD has pointed to the issue of out-of-touch admins who, when they finally return to active editing, take actions that are controversial, but can we not simply start a recall on admins who do problematic things due to being out of touch on the basis that they did problematic things and are out of touch? -- LWG talk 16:50, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
"can we not simply start a recall on admins who do problematic things due to being out of touch on the basis that they did problematic things and are out of touch?", that's what has happened, and yet here we are. CMD (talk) 16:49, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I'm sorry, but calling the last two admin recalls bullying is completely severed from reality. REAL_MOUSE_IRL talk 13:02, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
we need admins to abide by the spirit of the rule, rather than the letter given that active administrators actively engaged with this discussion do not agree what the spirit of the rule is, how do you expect someone who is less engaged to know that the spirit is different to the letter, let alone what it actually is? Things like edit warring/3RR and similar make it explicit what the spirit is and how that relates to the letter. The inactivity policy does not do that. Thryduulf (talk) 01:27, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
The problem with spirit of the rule is that it's arbitrary. The inactivity policy has not been arbitrary, expecting semi-active / inactive admins to acquiesce the two is an unreasonable ask. At the very least, they need to be made aware of changed community expectations in some regard. qedk (t 愛 c) 20:57, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
That isn't an unreasonable ask... And any admin who disagrees can hand in their mop. Expecting WP:GAME not to apply to admins is the unreasonable ask. Admins are held to a higher standard than non-admins, not a lower one. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 15:38, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
I've had some more time to think about this and I think the reason inactivity-based recalls for admins who appear to be deliberately editing just above the minimum threshold rub me the wrong way is that it seems to violate the principle that sanctions should be preventative, not punitive. I still don't feel like I've heard a solid case for what harm is prevented by recalling a minimally-active but otherwise unproblematic admin. Some might say "they aren't otherwise unproblematic if they are WP:GAMING the activity rules!" But WP:GAMING starts with the sentence Gaming the system means deliberately misusing Wikipedia policy or process for personal advantage at the expense of other editors or the Wikipedia community (my emphasis). I fail to see what "personal advantage" an admin who pops in once a year to make a few constructive edits is getting, and I definitely fail to see how that is "at the expense of other editors or the Wikipedia community". If an admin's minimal contributions aren't constructive, recall them for unconstructive editing, not for inactivity. I echo Thryduulf's sentiment that an admin can only harm the project by taking actions, and should be recalled on the basis of harmful actions they have actually taken. I don't see how edits that would otherwise be constructive become unconstructive in small quantities (assuming the minimum threshold of activity has been passed to keep us from being concerned about account compromise). On the other hand, a typical RFA consumes an amount of editor attention and time equivalent to years of contributions at the activity level community consensus apparently considers acceptable for an admin. So basically, my take: if an admin's edits are below the minimum threshold set by the community, they can be procedurally de-sysopped. If an admin's edits are unconstructive, they can be recalled for unconstructive editing, with no need to appeal to WP:GAMING. If an admin's edits are constructive, and above the minimum threshold set by the community, then it's not WP:GAMING, and a recall petition is a waste of time. In all cases WP:GAMING of activity thresholds is not an appropriate grounds for a recall petition. If people think that constructive editing above the minimum threshold is still grounds for de-sysopping, then they should seek community consensus to raise the minimum threshold. -- LWG talk 17:24, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
@LWG, this is a perfectly acceptable statement as far as I'm concerned, but it's still missing the point in the way that so much of this discussion has - the two admins who were recalled for gaming had been talked to about it already, over a protracted period of time and had not changed their approach. To my knowledge, this does not at all apply to the vast majority of low-activity admins. The philosophical discussion about admin activity is a real red herring here when what we're looking at is two specific cases of admins demonstrating specific behaviours, and not inactivity more broadly. -- asilvering (talk) 17:55, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
What have is examples of a few vocal editors who have a problem with activity levels the community has deemed minimally acceptable. We have no evidence that there was a consensus this was a problem, because neither of the administrators concerned stood at RFA - indeed in both recall petitions there were editors expressing opposition to recalling, despite that explicitly being irrelevant. If you think those specific behaviours are problematic then get a consensus that those behaviours are problematic. Thryduulf (talk) 19:09, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
If we're just talking about those two cases specifically, then I agree most of this discussion is missing the point. I'm replying to the discussion that seems to be happening, not the discussion that ought to be happening. I don't know all the context of those two cases, but from glancing through the recall discussions it seems there were other concerns about their conduct (i.e. the problem wasn't the low level of contribution, it was the low quality of contribution). I still feel that if the only objection to their conduct was a long pattern of editing just above the threshold, then they shouldn't have been recalled.  -- LWG talk 19:30, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
Yes, there were other concerns. That's why various editors here are talking about how this is filling up with strawman arguments. It's true that there are some editors who believe our inactivity standards are too low; whether they'd be able to get community consensus to raise them is an open question. (I personally would argue against it - if someone gets the inactivity reminder, goes "aw crap, I didn't realize it had been so long" and logs back in to handle a bunch of reports at WP:AIV, that's a bunch of reports no one else had to handle and I'm perfectly happy with that. I don't think you need to be terribly plugged-in to the community to know that replacing a bunch of text with "I'M A BANANA" is vandalism.) But both of the recalls so far have been for highly inactive admins who were dicks about it. Talking about this like it's about inactivity in general is inventing a problem that hasn't actually occurred. -- asilvering (talk) 20:12, 31 May 2025 (UTC)
I think the last statement is an unfair reduction. The core issue has to be that the inactivity policy is inadequate because otherwise the question of gaming does not arise. That is to say, if we had a significantly higher threshold, no one would care about gaming because the admins are already doing what the community expects. Also see SFR's reduction above about where gaming better is essentially admins adhering to community expectations better, which is a perspective I'm somewhat aligned with (not necessarily agreeable to it). It's not that simple. qedk (t 愛 c) 00:38, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
No, that isn't the core issue, and that's exactly what so many people have been trying to explain this whole time. -- asilvering (talk) 04:14, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Doesn't the gaming issue still arise if people are perceived to have a pattern of making edits that barely meet the threshold without meaningfully contributing? When we accuse people of gaming EC the issue isn't that community expectations exceed the EC requirements, it's that the community expects people to meet the EC requirements through meaningful contribution rather than trivial tinkering. -- LWG talk 16:28, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
You are not wrong, I was merely pointing out SFR's point above - which is to say that at a certain point the difference between token editing and constructive editing disappears; although imo, the difference is already thin and I had reiterated earlier that attributing an intent to inactivity in terms of gaming is a slippery slope and I also disagree with it for purely philosophical reasons alone (see WhatamIdoing's reply a few paragraphs above, who explains it in more coherent terms). qedk (t 愛 c) 17:48, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Having read most of the above discussion, I'd like to add a perspective here from an admin who appears on the list of 307 'semi-active' admins that was linked above by Dekimasu (I had not been aware of this list previously, despite it being around since 2007). Like others whose activity has decreased, much of my editing activity was in the first 10 years after creating my account. It has been less since then, and my admin actions have never been that high. Despite the reservations some have (and will doubtless still have) about this aspect of my history, I did do two stints on the Arbitration Committee from 2009 to 2010 and 2013 to 2014.
I also recognise names here and there (among both those admins still active, those who are less active, and those who recently handed in the admin bit or who have had the bit procedurally removed). Most of those people made their own choices about their changing levels of activity. For my part, when the activity requirements first came in, I made a conscious choice, as various other parts of my life began to take priority, to set my own activity levels to check in at least once a month and to create at least one article a year (alongside other edits). That may seem low to some, but I wanted to remain engaged with and abreast of at least the major developments with Wikipedia (if not the detail) and aspects of the editing and administrating community. Most of my other activity (not logged) has involved reading news and noticeboards around en-Wikipedia.
I have observed, with a semi-detached level of interest, the steady changes and discussions around logged activity requirements, at times trying to work out whether I was still 'active' enough! This was all against a background of one day aiming to return to higher levels of activity, still drawn to Wikipedia because of the emotional, intellectual and social investment made in this project over the years. I agree with what others have said above about the human element. Many may have stories similar to that related here.
If you really want to find out what is going on with semi-active admins and what might (time permitting) make them more active or engaged again, I would suggest talking to them. Invite them to a centralised discussion and see how many turn up (you may have to allow some lag time for them to see the invite). Not all will be willing to participate, or want to go into any level of detail, but you may get a better idea of how to approach this from a more human perspective and find out why some people make the choice to keep the tools through periods of inactivity rather than handing them back in and asking for them back later (I have my own theories about this, but would not want to prejudice any discussion). Carcharoth (talk) 14:04, 2 June 2025 (UTC)

I appreciate your perspective, I would enjoy your thoughts on the discussion because the basic principle of conversations like these is to disagree - it's not prejudicial at all if it helps other editors on this wiki understand where you're coming from and what you think. I for one, think specifically your perspective as a "semi-active" admin is quite valuable here. qedk (t 愛 c) 16:53, 2 June 2025 (UTC)
The insights are not very groundbreaking, just thoughts on how some people might see having the admin bit as them still being a "part" of the community, and that the act of giving it up (even voluntarily and with the option of taking it back up again later) would feel like them stepping further away when they might not want to do that (some people find it better to take a real  break and come back refreshed). Some of the people who are inactive are so because they have better things to do, some will be because they don't have a choice, and they would love to come back more often but cannot. Psychology is a funny thing. Most of those who are less active appreciate what it is like (and the investment of time that it takes) to be very active. Those who have only ever been very active might have less appreciation of what it is like to be less active. The final point, that I forgot to make earlier, is that it would be nice to have some stability, rather than shifting goalposts. I know that is a function of the community's inability to reach a stable consensus, but is worth considering. Set some standards, and then leave it alone for a few years. I know that is rarely possible on Wikipedia, but there are times when I remember it being done like that. Carcharoth (talk) 09:11, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
What shifting goalposts are you referring to? Have admin inactivity requirements changed since 2022? Levivich (talk) 17:16, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
In theory, I should know that, maybe? If you are right that they have not changed since 2022, I apologise. I got the impression that they had changed a lot since they first came in, but maybe I am remembering the many discussions attempting to change them. This reminds me of a short-lived attempt to impose moratoriums (moratoria?) on discussions to help encourage productivity (or discourage endless circular discussions). It never seemed to work, though it was a formal ArbCom remedy in the Macedonia naming case IIRC (or maybe the Ireland naming one). I digress. Is the progression in activity requirements over time laid out? No reason it should be. The status of a policy/guideline/essay used to be an indicator of its stability. How stable is this aspect of WP:ADMIN? Carcharoth (talk) 18:17, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
fwiw, I read "shifting goalposts" in your original post more as "please don't change the inactivity rules, since shifting goalposts is frustrating" rather than "please don't change the inactivity rules, since shifting goalposts again would be frustrating", and I think it works just as well that way. -- asilvering (talk) 18:26, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
I'm in the same boat as you, Car: I'm not entirely sure how often inactivity requirements have changed. From memory, I only recall the 2022 change (during the time I've been editing, since late 2018), but if they have changed often, then I'd agree the instability could be a challenge for admins. Levivich (talk) 19:50, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
While the minimum requirements communicated in policy haven't changed (although RFC: Resysoppings after five years with no administrative actions from November last year is slightly related), it is clear from this discussion that the expectations of at least some editors have. Thryduulf (talk) 21:16, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
I don't believe that's clear from this discussion, or relevant to it. I don't equate minimum requirements communicated in policy with editors expectations, and I would expect expectations to differ from minimum requirements, both then and now. And even if some editors' expectations have changed between then and now, that is to be expected. In fact, expectations changing over time is one of the reasons we have minimum activity requirements. Levivich (talk) 22:21, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
I think there's a massive difference between community expectations in situ and applying, or rather enforcing said community expectation via a procedural process that was never intended to apply to this particular usage. In fact, the second part is the more pertinent point of discussion here that we are proposing to amend to some extent, a part of which is figuring out the correct way to align community expectations in some regard such that a semi-active admin can understand what exactly is expected of them in the first place, otherwise it's just putting the cart before horse, no? qedk (t 愛 c) 20:55, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
I've spent a few days thinking about this message because I really don't understand how, after all this discussion, you still seem to not understand some basic points, as evidenced by your message above. I say this because you wrote a procedural process that was never intended to apply to this particular usage. Of course it was! This is exactly what recall is for (and I say this as someone who has spent years vocally lobbying for it). Recall is for the situation where an admin loses community trust without actually violating any bright-line rules. Clear violation of rules is what arbcom is for -- recall is for those cases that arbcom won't handle because the admin never broke any clear rules. I can't wrap my mind around you saying that recall wasn't for situations like these.
You also write such that a semi-active admin can understand what exactly is expected of them in the first place -- yet the whole point of activity requirements -- of the requirement that an admin be active -- is because a semi-active admin can't know what is expected of them, but admins should know what is expected of them, which is why semi-active admins -- which I'm defining as any admin not active enough to keep abreast of community expectations -- should not be admins at all.
And then there is the hypocrisy angle that you just don't seem to want to engage with directly. You yourself have made many blocks for "not here to build an encyclopedia" [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] or violating similarly-vague "rules" like "disruptive editing" and "WP:CIR" [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. How is it possible that you are comfortable with editors being required to adhere to vague community expectations like "here to build an encyclopedia" or "non-disruptive editing" or "competence is required," which have absolutely no bright-line rules or clear definitions -- but you seem to have such a problem with admins -- the ones who are enforcing those vague community expectations through blocks! -- being held to a community expectation of "be active". Like that is unfair to you, but "not here to build an encyclopedia" is OK? That's just hypocrisy--how can you not see that?
"Wikipedia has no firm rules," we have vague expectations like "be here to build an encyclopedia" and "be active to be an admin." It's not putting the cart before the horse to enforce these vague expectations ... it may not be a great idea -- clear rules might be better, in fact I kind of think they are -- but it is the system that Wikipedia has had for nearly twenty-five years now.
I'm trying to understand where you're coming from, but I've failed, all I can see is "rules for thee but not for me," which I don't think is what you mean (I AGF that you don't), but I am having a hard time understand your viewpoint beyond my impression that you think adminship is an entitlement that should not be taken away except in the case of clear violation of clear rules -- which isn't how editing privileges work (trust me, I know all about it!), so it's not how admin privileges should work, either. Those two inactivity recalls were for "clearly not here to be an admin," the direct analog of "clearly not here to build an encyclopedia," and I just don't get how you think that this is somehow unfair to admins. Levivich (talk) 15:25, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Your entire reply misconstrues intentions for actions. I do not enjoy the reduction to bright-line rules vs. descriptive rules - that is not how things are done on this wiki and it's obvious to everyone and bringing up a very absurd description of my own application of aforementioned rules as hypocrisy is ad hominem and irrelevant. I think I will just keep it simple because engaging with this feels unfair. When I blocked those editors, they were actively harmful for the wiki, admins by virtue of their inactivity are not harmful for the wiki (as others have repeatedly iterated and explained on this thread). Arguably, experienced semi-active admins (and crats) have a perspective that the uber-present community will not have and have the potential to return to the wiki in a much more beneficial capacity, it's really as simple as that. Lastly, if you will read my replies above, I have the capacity to understand that editors on this thread primarily disagree with me and I suggested a much simpler solution of amending policy pages to reflect the updated community expectations (per FFF, SFR and others). qedk (t 愛 c) 16:57, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Criticizing an argument as hypocritical is not an ad hominem. As has been said above, one does not need to have the admin permissions in order to provide a perspective--former admins can provide the same perspective as inactive admins. It seems your quarrel isn't with WP:RECALL at all, but rather with the existence of admin activity requirements. I support them, and as for what harm inactive admins can cause, that's been thoroughly covered in the various RFCs we've had over the past 15 years about admin activity requirements (security, keeping up with changing community expectations, bad admin actions, etc.). Levivich (talk) 18:23, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Can you explain what that massive difference would be? This appears to be within the bounds of the intended usage of the procedural process, why would do say otherwise? Horse Eye's Back (talk) 15:36, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Do we have a policy about redirects in native script? I refer to יוסף אשרמן as an example of what I mean. Given the vast number of articles we have about people and places whose native name is not written in Roman letters, this practice could get seriously out of hand.  However, I don't find this as one of the criteria for speedy deletion. The closest I can find is in WP:TITLE: "Names not originally in a Latin alphabet, such as Greek, Chinese, or Russian names, must be romanized", but can we assume this applies to redirect names? I believe it does, but before I start deleting things I'd like more opinions. Zerotalk 01:51, 1 June 2025 (UTC)

Not a policy, but an essay summarizing a guideline: Wikipedia:Redirects in languages other than English Anomie⚔ 01:53, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
It's worth noting that this essay (commonly referred to by its many shortcuts - WP:RLOTE, WP:RFOREIGN, WP:FORRED, WP:RFFL, WP:RLANG) is one of (possibly even the) most strongly supported rationales at RfD. Whether there is affinity between a language and subject is very often subjective, but I can't recall I've ever seen the deletion of a redirect from an unambiguous official or most common name in the subjects native language. At the other end of the scale, redirects with (almost) no connection between the language and subject are almost always deleted - for example while בִּנְיָמִין נְתַנְיָהוּ → Benjamin Netanyahu would definitely be kept, ג'ו ביידן → Joe Biden would be deleted.  Another good rule of thumb is that if the term is mentioned in the lead of the article then it is very likely to be kept if nominated, especially if it's bolded and/or in the fist sentence. Thryduulf (talk) 02:35, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Incidentally, Thryduulf, Bibi is someone with two Hebrew redirects: בִּנְיָמִין נְתַנְיָהוּ and בנימין נתניהו. I wonder who, exactly, would ever find the article by searching with nikud. Zerotalk 06:52, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Presumably someone who was reading a website that wrote the name with nikud and used the highlight>right click>search flow on a browser with Wikipedia set as a search engine. -- LWG talk 13:30, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes it could happen, but very few web sites write it with nikud (less than one in a thousand if Google counts can be trusted). Zerotalk 06:27, 2 June 2025 (UTC)
Hello. I came here after @Zero0000 told me on my talk page to, "Please stop creating redirects in Hebrew script. We don't do that and I've request more input about it from the community." Though I asked, "If you can point to a policy or guideline that prohibits this practice I will gladly abide by it."
After reading the relevant policy and guidelines, it would seem that there was no policy supporting Zero0000's ask other than that he does not like it. If my understanding is correct, then I will continue to make these constructive additions when I create "a redirect from an unambiguous official or most common name in the subjects native language"... To be sure. An Israeli, may for example have a redirect of their Hebrew language equivalent, if I understand the above correctly, though to add a Russian language foreign language equivalent, would not make sense or be valid unless it was, for example, a Russian-Israeli subject for the article in question? Iljhgtn (talk) 03:07, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
@Thryduulf "Another good rule of thumb is that if the term is mentioned in the lead of the article then it is very likely to be kept if nominated, especially if it's bolded and/or in the fist sentence." I often will add the directly related foreign language equivalent in the lead using the Langx template, and then following that I will create the redirect, if it is an Israeli and they do not already have that redirect, but I always follow only if it is the most directly and commonly related language, for example with your Benjamin Netanyahu example. I do not believe that there is any prohibition on this type of edit and I believe these to be constructive edits and I am often thanked for them. Iljhgtn (talk) 03:11, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
A good recent example might be Henry Foner (chemist). Also, I was helped a while back in terms of which template to use with guidance from User:Harrz who first suggested to use R to transliteration Rcat instead of the R from alternative language template for these redirects. Iljhgtn (talk) 04:18, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Should Hebrew redirects use Ktiv haser or Ktiv male? -- Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul (talk) 20:44, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
Based on my very limited understanding of Hewbrew, either or both depending on which are commonly used in relation to the subject. Thryduulf (talk) 20:56, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
My opinion is that the policy that article titles must be romanized applies equally well to redirect titles. This is also in line with decades of practice and exceptions are like hens teeth. There is also no purpose. Anyone who comes to the English wikipedia looking for יוסף אשרמן knows how to spell it in roman letters and in any case can find it with a simple search.  Are we going to have a redirect in Chinese characters for every Chinese person or place, a redirect in Japanese characters for every Japanese person or place, and then there are multiple Indian scripts, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, Korean, Thai, and on and on. what about redirects in hieroglyphics for ancient Egyptians? If this is going to become a standard practice it will be a fundamental change to the outward facing image of the encyclopedia. Maybe that would be a good thing, but we should at least establish a definite policy on it. Zerotalk 04:45, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I note that the issue has been discussed at WT:TITLE, for example in archive 30. Opinions were mixed. Zerotalk 04:57, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I have read through that archived discussion. The main risk, concerns, or opposition was centered around people inserting invalid or vandalism type foreign language equivalent redirects into Wikipedia, and that there would not be enough labor to help identify and correct for these acts of vandalism. Given that you are citing a discussion that happened 14.5 years ago, I think it is likely fair to say that there is a more robust editor base than before. Regardless, there was no clear opposition of the valid inclusion of non-vandalism type foreign character redirects, even in the archive you cited from.  Iljhgtn (talk) 05:11, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I was not familiar with the "hens teeth" line, but when I googled it, it said, "Extremely rare, unattainable or non-existent". If that is the meaning, then that could not simply be any further from the truth.
Since you first mentioned Chinese characters. Let's see what we can find, shall we?
Mao Zedong type in 毛泽东 and tell me what you find.
Or what about his wife, Luo Yixiu, type 羅一秀.
Next you mention Japanese, how about we try Shogun and type 将軍. What then?
Or, Saudi Arabia, type المملكة العربية السعودية.
Or how about Laos, type in ສາທາລະນະລັດ ປະຊາທິປະໄຕ ປະຊາຊົນລາວ.
"Hen's teeth"? If that meant "extremely common to the point of being near ubiquitous" then I would agree.
Lastly, "If this is going to become a standard practice it will be a fundamental change to the outward facing image of the encyclopedia". This is false on every level. The "outward facing" aspect of Wikipedia does not change at ALL with foreign language equivalent REDIRECTS precisely because they are REDIRECTS and not main space titles! If we were talking about titles of regular main space pages, I would agree, but this is in fact one of the core, common, and regularly valid uses of redirects from foreign language character equivalents! Iljhgtn (talk) 05:05, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
You show me a handful of examples out of countless thousands of articles? That doesn't disprove "hen's teeth". Exceedingly few such redirects exist compared to the number of articles which in principle could have them. Zerotalk 05:11, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I showed you that in mere seconds. If you want, I'll carve out a few hours and give you thousands of examples. Would that satisfy your hens teeth?  Iljhgtn (talk) 05:13, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
It is a well established principle that the fact that other stuff exists is not a reason for it to continue to exist. Please address the issue raised above: should each article have a redirect in Hebrew, another in Chinese, another in Japanese, etc.? Clearly that would be ridiculous per the principles at WP:NOTDIRECTORY: Wikipedia should not list everything. Johnuniq (talk) 05:48, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
No one is advocating that. If there is a direct tie, e.g. a movie's original release title, or a political figure from a country that uses that scripts. We wouldn't have a Hebrew title for an American president or vice versa or a Chinese redirect to a Russian man. That is what WP:FORRED is for. We have 80,000+ r from lang redirects, several tens of thousands of which are non-Latin. PARAKANYAA (talk) 08:08, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
@PARAKANYAA is exactly correct. It only makes sense to have a foreign language redirect for a subject where the foreign language is most directly tied to that subject. Also, I will mention that r from transliteration is a big one that I was encouraged by @Harrz to use recently and he might have more to say on that, but I think there are many more templates that use this type of redirect than just R from alternative language.  Iljhgtn (talk) 13:41, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
It's easy to type a non-roman character into the search box and get lots of hits. It's not so easy to judge how common it is. For that you also need to know how many articles don't have such redirects but could. For example, I looked the 40-ish cities and city municipalties in Thailand and found 4 redirects in Thai. (That's more than I expected.) When I looked at Israeli authors, I found that most had redirects in Hebrew but only because you (Iljhgtn) added them in the past 6 months. (Previously there were a few added in 2011.) Look, I'm not mortally opposed to this practice, I just think that somewhere in the policy pages the issue should be provided with guidelines. If the community thinks it's a good thing we should recommend it. Zerotalk 06:35, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I actually fully agree that mostly policy and guidelines should fully and explicitly either prohibit or permit (and even recommend) one thing or another. I have often encountered and found myself engaged in discussions of the past where other editors actually like the ambiguity and gray zone. I do not. I prefer clear "do this" or "do not do this" policy guidance, and so I am in agreement with you on that @Zero0000. Iljhgtn (talk) 13:43, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I wouldn't say "exceedingly few" given that 83487 articles transclude {{R from alternative language}}, a sizable portion of which are non-Latin scripts. PARAKANYAA (talk) 08:05, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
And this is only the ones that are rcat categorized. Which, sadly (they are very useful), is not very many PARAKANYAA (talk) 08:13, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
By actual measurement (woolly due to the imprecise meaning of "roman script") there are 45,000 transclusions of {{R from alternative language}} with non-roman script. This is 0.6% of articles, which is more than I would have guessed. Zerotalk 09:15, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
What about also {{R from transliteration}}? There are MANY, many more templates that use redirects of a foreign language equivalent! Iljhgtn (talk) 13:44, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
This is also only the ones that are RCAT tagged, so duplicate that a bit. PARAKANYAA (talk) 15:09, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes. Good point. Iljhgtn (talk) 22:45, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
Like Johnuniq above, I am not seeing what a redirect page brings here. If an en.wiki article carries the name in a non-English main language, then the standard search does a decent job of presenting the relevant article, for example Duncan Livingstone / Donnchadh MacDhun and Hu Bo / 胡波. (My 1st example was going to be Sun Tailor, an indy musician I tagged for notability many years ago, but I see there is now also a redirect page at ארנון נאור.) So we have on-wiki search, we have inter-wiki article links at each article page top via Wikidata (which also has a table of per-language labels and descriptions); I don't see the need for an extra interlanguage redirect layer. AllyD (talk) 07:24, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
What is the scale of the issue here? Would there be a reason why it needs to be dealt with via speedy instead of RfD (i.e., is this another Neelix-sized case, in which case we'd probably create a temporary X-criterion instead of a permanent R-criterion). If relatively few foreign language redirects are problematic they can probably be dealt with on a case-by-case basis with whatever consensus arises at RfD instead. Alpha3031 (t • c) 07:28, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
The purpose is quite clear in that anglicizations are often very inconsistent and if one is basing an article off of non-English sources, the native-language term would be the most efficient way to find the article. How much to anglicize is also unclear, e.g. should we delete Türkiye? such redirects have saved me time repeatedly, standard search does a poor job of this kind of thing when there can be dozens of different anglicizations of someone's name. It getting out of hand is not a concern as long as WP:FORRED is kept to, e.g. it should only be done for topics where there is a clear relationship, like a film's original release title or the native language name of someone from that country. I also don't see why we're discussing script rather than language. PARAKANYAA (talk) 08:01, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
However, this advantage is minimized if the name is given in native script in the article lead or infobox, which is much more common and something we encourage. Zerotalk 09:19, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
I say this is a "Why not both" approach. Also, if that is not in the lead, but then someone adds that to the lead, would they not then immediately be able to add the foreign language redirect immediately following that addition to the lead? That is common practice and it is one of the many edits that I routinely make. Several years in that one particular edit has only ever been viewed as constructive, though I've had suggestions over the years on how to improve it. For example, I used to only ever use Rcat {{R from alternative language}} and now I use that paired with {{R to transliteration}} most often, making the distinction of when a subject title is a transliteration or a translation.  Iljhgtn (talk) 13:48, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
It still has a quite large benefit by 1) showing in the searchbar, saving a lot of time 2) not being easy to remove in cases like vandalism/article cleaning 3) foreign-script variations that are commonly used in sources but not in the article. Also, it really isn't in there as much as you think, particularly older or less well-maintained articles. Often I would just have the Russian name to search, it wouldn't be in the article, and the transliteration was inconsistent so it took me ages to even figure out if we had an article. Would not have happened if such a redirect existed.
I just don't see what the problem with it is. It provides me and several other readers with a large benefit, for what cost? It's not like we have some sort of Latin script purity in redirects language aside. We have redirects from Unicode. Emojis. Should we start deleting redirects from original, non-English supported diacritic cases? PARAKANYAA (talk) 15:15, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
If we delete these redirects we would, applying the same logic, need to also delete thousands of redirects including µm, TETЯIS, I ❤ NY, ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, 🂡, A♠, ♞, √2, ∫, π, ſ, 🇺🇸, ₹, Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, Αθήνα, etc, all of which seem extremely useful redirects to have to me. Thryduulf (talk) 15:54, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
No, at least a few of these are terms you might reasonably encounter (without a further explanation) in English language texts, e.g. the maths symbols and the micrometre. Helping people who find something unfamiliar and unexplained inside English texts is a basic use of a redirect on enwiki. But there are no English language texts which will e.g. put Mao's or Netanyahu's name in the original script and not in Latin script, so no readers of English texts will need these redirects to understand the text. Please don't use such hyperbolic strawmen by comparing apples and پرتقال . Fram (talk) 12:11, 2 June 2025 (UTC)
Redirects are cheap, so my default is to say if Iljhgtn is willing to put in the work great, go for it, unless I can see some sort of tangible harm it does. Possible forms of harm, in descending order of seriousness in my view:
Verifiability of alternate names. This is why we generally don't accept redirects from languages with no clear connection to the subject. But for cases like official names of persons/entities that are widely used in sources, this is not an issue.
Inequity if we have this for Hebrew names and no one is doing this for other languages. WP:SOFIXIT and WP:NORUSH and WP:OTHERSTUFFDOESNTEXIST
??? Those two things are basically the only possible harms I can see from adding foreign-language redirects.
On the other hand, like PARAKANYAA I also personally benefit greatly from that kind of redirect since I frequently read non-English sources and it is helpful to be able to quickly copy/paste native-script names without having to figure out how to romanize them first (often that's how I find the correct romanization for further research). If this kind of thing is helpful for people like me and PARAKANYAA, and doesn't hurt anyone else, and Iljhgtn is willing to volunteer the work, why wouldn't we accept it? -- LWG talk 15:59, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
+1, these redirects are extremely useful, I use them constantly, and I am shocked that their existence is in doubt at all. Toadspike [Talk] 19:43, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
To be clear. I also add these for other languages. Though Hebrew is a favorite for me. I also add for Palestinian language pages (with Arabic) and Russian, and Yiddish (though admittedly to a lesser degree). I am glad that others see this activity for the constructive edit that it is, and I welcome as many more to join in and participate as might be interested and have the time to do so! Iljhgtn (talk) 22:43, 1 June 2025 (UTC)
This is not perhaps precisely the same issue, but I have serious concerns around Iljhgtn's editing concerning Hebrew names.  Here he took an article with two foreign-language names and elevated only Hebrew to the infobox.  Here he added a "native name" with no sourcing for a person who was born in the US and lived there for at least half of his life.  The edits here are similar; I can see no evidence that Gaitsgory has a "native name" in Hebrew (why not in Tajik, Romanian, or Russian?).  These are merely edits I happened to have noticed because articles were on my watchlist, but overall this project seems to me to be probably full of errors.  --JBL (talk) 00:04, 2 June 2025 (UTC)
Restricting to just those with the most direct connection to Hebrew does seem to make sense. I can take special care to do that moving forward.  Iljhgtn (talk) 00:22, 2 June 2025 (UTC)
@Iljhgtn I don't mean to pile on here, but please try not to translate names without a reliable source. We've had problems with Korean names written with Chinese characters being wrong, because people simply invent translations (see MOS:HANJASOURCE). We can avoid situations like this by relying on reliable sources for translations/transliterations. Toadspike [Talk] 20:00, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
When you say This is not perhaps precisely the same issue you are partly correct, it is at most tangentially relevant to whether redirects from non-Latin scripts are wanted. If you think it warrants discussion, then you should initiate one in an appropriate venue. If you feel that any individual redirect does not meet the guidance at WP:FORRED then you should discuss that with the creator and/or nominate them for discussion at RfD. Thryduulf (talk) 00:22, 2 June 2025 (UTC)
Also, when there are multiple language that seem to be of equal foreign importance, I do my best to include both. Such as Gregory Eskin. Iljhgtn (talk) 00:24, 2 June 2025 (UTC)

I'm cross-posting this from Wikipedia_talk:Naming_conventions_(geographic_names)#Clarification on "use modern names" (WP:MPN) as no one has responded there.
I'd like to clarify how this sentence from WP:MPN should be interpreted: "Older names should be used in appropriate historical contexts when a substantial majority of reliable modern sources do the same"
Am I understanding this correctly that when we decide which name to use in a historical context, we should do so based on what current sources say when referring to that historical period, not what contemporary sources from that historical period say?
What brought me here is that on the Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Olena Zelenska articles, some editors have changed the spelling of their birthplace from Kryvyi Rih to Krivoy Rog in the infobox, on the grounds that Russian spellings were used in the Soviet Union in 1978 when they were both born. I understand this argument; however, if I'm understanding WP:MPN correctly, what matters is not what English romanisation was used when they were born, but what romanisation is currently used today to refer to Kryvyi Rih in 1978. Is this understanding correct?
I think my understanding is correct because WP:MPN also says "Names have changed both because cities have been formally renamed and because cities have been taken from one state by another; in both cases, however, we are interested in what reliable English-language sources now use." (emphasis mine) However, I'd like to find out if there's community consensus on this.
Thanks! Helpful Cat🐈(talk) 12:13, 5 June 2025 (UTC)

Your understanding is correct. Firefangledfeathers (talk / contribs) 12:30, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Your interpretation matches the way I've always understood it. Explicit note of the old name can be added if it will aid understanding or is important for context (e.g. "... born in Kryvyi Rih (then known as Krivoy Rog)") but that isn't always necessary or useful. More often helpful is noting the modern name/spelling when quoting old sources, but again that isn't required on every use. Thryduulf (talk) 13:05, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
@Firefangledfeathers, @Thryduulf great, thanks! Helpful Cat🐈(talk) 14:19, 5 June 2025 (UTC)

We need to reduce the threshold from 500 edits - 250 edits. 500 edits is just too much and unnecessary. Datawikiperson (talk) 15:37, 5 June 2025 (UTC)

Why?
We recently had a large discussion about increasing the requirements for extended-confirmed to 500 edits and 90 days (Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Extended confirmed definition). Although that proposal was snow opposed, the comments suggest that increasing the number of edits would get at least some support. Thryduulf (talk) 15:49, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Because it's too much. I'm just asking this question because I want to know why it is at this Huge number. Isn't 250 edits enough? Datawikiperson (talk) 15:53, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
In my experience, true WP:CLUE develops around the 1000-3000 edit mark for most editors. signed, Rosguill talk 15:56, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Datawikiperson, it's used as a proxy for editing experience, familiarity with the rules, maturity, something like that. It is not a good proxy for editing experience. Unless someone comes up with a better idea, I guess it is here to stay. (I like the notion of true WP:CLUEness. If only we knew how to measure it). Sean.hoyland (talk) 16:03, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
There is also the idea that an edit count threshold is a barrier that people who do not think WP:SOCK applies to them have to cross. There is a hope/belief/assumption that the barrier might reduce the amount of sockpuppetry in contentious topic areas. It's possible that it does the opposite, by preferentially selecting for the most dedicated and persistent partisan editors and concentrating them in contentious topic areas. A solution that is often proposed is to lower the barrier. Then neutral, sensible editors will flow into the topic areas and dilute the partisan nonsense. This is a fantasy, in my view. Those people are not out there. They presumably have better things to do. You can see who's out there, thousands of potential editors, by looking at partisan media reporting and social media commentary about articles in contentious topic areas in Wikipedia. Yikes! Sean.hoyland (talk) 16:34, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
As the person who started that RFC, I'm doubtful that there's a significant difference between 300 edits and 500 edits.  People who make 1 edits might not manage 10, but people who make 300 edits are fairly likely to make 500 eventually.  I do think there's a difference between someone who makes 500 edits in 30 days vs 500 edits spread over multiple months.
For the people who actually achieve 500 edits (which is a very small number), it usually takes a year or longer to get to that point.  The OP here appears to be on track for the median experience. WhatamIdoing (talk) 05:52, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
See, to me it's not about eventually, but more the level of experience already acquired that 500 edits very roughly demonstrates. Remsense 🌈 论 05:54, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
This protection only applies to ~7800 of over 7 million articles (~1/10 of 1%) - which have been magnets for disruption. There is a backlog in the ECP Edit Request queue, an area I'd love to see more editor participation in. — xaosflux Talk 17:09, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
The number of edits is arbitrary. A person may achieve something in one edit that another takes 10 edits to do. However, as Sean says, it's the best system we've got for protecting contentious articles without putting too much power in the hands of administrators. I note that the OP has made 282 edits, which would clearly be on the right side of their proposal but is on the wrong side of current practice. Phil Bridger (talk) 19:28, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
The barrier to socks is worth preserving, imperfect though it is. It's true that some seriously good editors are dissuaded but we haven't found a better way to reduce the number of seriously bad editors. Since EC was introduced, the experience in contentious topics and the quality of articles (I'm most familiar with PIA) has increased enormously. It has been the most (maybe only) successful innovation since 3RR was cut to 1RR. Zerotalk 06:50, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
So I'll start by saying I've never really liked ECP, well maybe in its earliest form as 1RR light applied to one specific page, but I digress, and I was very skeptical of broadening its application beyond topics covered by discretionary sanctions. However it really is the least bad way we've found to rate limit disruption so far. In practice many of the pages it's applied to are not ones we would want new users to cut their teeth on anyway since pages that warrant ECP are also the ones that tend to be less pleasant to edit for most people and place newcomers on a steep learning curve well steeper than usual anyway in an environment that is very much sink or swim.Even with the 500 edit threshold, SPAs and sockmasters manage to become EC as a matter of routine but for many though be no means all of them it results in some combination of increased chance of being spotted and increased time investment necessary to cause their preferred form of disruption, hence the rate limiting. It is by no means perfect, and it has a lot of collateral, and I'm the first to advocate for keeping this place as open as possible, but we really are in a situation where there are no good options, only some slightly less bad ones. 184.152.65.118 (talk) 01:21, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
It was Guerillero who invented EC on a lark, right? I'm not sure even they like it. It's got the subtle design of a dugout canoe. Remsense 🌈 论 01:44, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Not quite, in fact you're seven years off and it was EdJohnston who got the ball rolling. It originated as a bespoke remedy in one specific ARBAA AE case where it did in fact function as a softer 1RR, was subsequently expanded under ARBGG, and WP:ECP2016, long before ARPIA3 more rigorously formalized its application. And now you too can propagate institutional knowledge along because I certainly don't have time to do it on anything like a regular basis anymore.What's most amusing to me is that many of the issues discussed in that original AE request still keep coming up again to this very day. But that's Wikipedia for you, chasing our tails since 2001. 184.152.65.118 (talk) 02:24, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
ECP2016 was in response to PIA3 -- Guerillero Parlez Moi 10:18, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Yeah that's right I guess was getting that confused with an ARCA to ARBPIA3 or perhaps ARBPIA4 that turned it into a standardized remedy. Actually that might have been more recently, I'd have to check. But I haven't really been around much for the last decade, and the memory comes and goes anyway. 184.152.65.118 (talk) 13:59, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
This should be at the very least doubled in numbers not reduced.Moxy🍁 02:47, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
I support an increase in the number, not a reduction, to weed out vandals and incompetents. I do not know if there is a restriction on creating AfDs, but if not, there should be a similar one. Xxanthippe (talk) 04:32, 8 June 2025 (UTC).
Agreed, in a previous discussion about this I suggested 1000/30. It's only a very small subset of articles that it affects, and most of those by definition are not good areas for inexperienced editors. Black Kite (talk) 14:01, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
I guess we don't have a lot of dials to turn, but I think the edit count requirement is a better dial than account age. It's not really possible to predict what effects changing it from 500 to 1000 would have on the characteristics of the EC population, but we do know that it would extract an extra 500 revisions from every account that ends up getting itself blocked post-grant. That's a lot of revisions, probably mostly okay. If we had done it back in 2018, I think the upper limit would have been around 2.4 million extra revisions, assuming optimistically they all made it from 500 to 1000 before they were blocked. Either way, better EC gaming detection would also help. Sean.hoyland (talk) 14:33, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
You now what, yeah I’m good with 500/30 Datawikiperson (talk) 12:01, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
When you reach 500 edits you can look at this plot and get a rough estimate of your chance of surviving. At your current editing rate, it's looking good. Sean.hoyland (talk) 14:50, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
What do you mean by "Surviving"? Datawikiperson (talk) 14:54, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Not getting blocked for things like pointlessly getting into an edit war over APEC Business Travel Cards or the Modified Mercalli intensity scale. That kind of thing. It's surprisingly common. Sean.hoyland (talk) 15:18, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
That plot shows that doing the required edits over a longer time correlates to slightly better outcomes, but I would warn anyone just glancing at it that the scale on the left does not start at zero, so even the blue line goes pretty horizontal somewhere in the sixties. Phil Bridger (talk) 16:01, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes, that's true, but the plot is intended to highlight the difference in outcome likelihoods in the first few months after the EC grant. As a way to predict the actual outcome for an individual it's probably about as useful as astrology. There is, for example, an account that registered in 2016, made no edits, then in 2024 made 500 edits in less than two and half days, immediately acquired the EC grant and that account is doing fine. Sean.hoyland (talk) 02:27, 10 June 2025 (UTC)

There is an ongoing discussion about the future of the WP:DIALECT naming convention, that is, the naming of articles about dialects and language varieties. We invite fellow Wikipedians to join the discussion and provide their valuable feedback! – Aca (talk) 08:44, 8 June 2025 (UTC)

Do folks think it would be a good idea to preemptively give rollbackers and NPP users access to the ability of CheckUser temporary accounts ? (The rights do not do anything at the moment, but they should allow folks with the rights to figure out if two temporary accounts are from the same IP once the rollout of the Temporary Accounts feature) Sohom (talk) 18:54, 8 June 2025 (UTC)

No. We cannot apply it to all accounts automatically. Per the access policy, users will need to apply for access to the right. voorts (talk/contributions) 19:05, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
@Voorts My reading of the policy was the user needs to be in a group that has the safeguards outlined in the policy ? (As opposed to explicitly requiring that folks follow the process all over again) I would consider rollbackers and NPP folks to have met and exceeded all of criteria mentioned there. (cc @SGrabarczuk (WMF) who was involved in the tech-migration side of the project) Sohom (talk) 19:14, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Hmm, I'm not sure that's true. I've definitely granted rollback to accounts less than 6 months old or with less than 300 edits before. The guideline for rollback is 200 mainspace edits, see WP:Rollback#Requesting rollback rights, and WP:NPPCRITERIA says 90 days and 500 undeleted mainspace edits. Both of these are less restrictive than the 6 months + 300 edits WMF requirement. Mz7 (talk) 20:55, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Going forward, we could make the requirements for NPP/rollback the same as the minimum/whatever additional requirements we impose for temporary accounts access. voorts (talk/contributions) 21:35, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Hello @Sohom Datta. @Voorts is correct. The right may not be automatically granted to a group of users. It can be granted manually to those who require this specific access in accordance with the access policy. This right carries requirements that may be different from rollbacker or NPP users. There is also an expectation for the user who gets this right to agree to the terms of use given this right grants the user access to private data (IP addresses). I hope this helps. -- NKohli (WMF) (talk) 11:15, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
@NKohli (WMF) Could you explain why this cannot be bundled ? I'm still at a loss why we cannot update our policies to meet the minimum, filter out folks in the groups to meet the official criteria and give them temporary-account CU privileges. To my understanding, they will still need to click through and agree to the terms of use even if the right is granted post-facto. Creating a requirement for granting two rights while requesting one will create a unnecessary overhead and bureaucracy on the side of admins and folks who are engaged in good-faith vandalism reversion. Sohom (talk) 11:39, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
@Sohom Datta to clarify - as long as the user who is getting this right is explicitly applying for it, and meets the requirements, they can be granted the right. This is the second criteria as listed under the policy: Submit an access request to local administrators, bureaucrats where local consensus dictates 
As long as this requirement is met, it is perfectly okay to grant a user holding any group this right. Does this clarify?  NKohli (WMF) (talk) 12:30, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
@NKohli (WMF) I understand that the policy exists. I am asking for a rationale why the policy demands that we do things in this idiosyncratic way (this is non-standard compared to almost every permission grant I've seen in the last four years, and frankly seems like completely unnecessary bureaucracy). Were local-wiki administrators consulted before this global policy was instituted (if so could you link to the consultation/notes from it) ? Was there a global RFC, phabricator discussion or mailing list discussions about the policy that I can look at to understand it's context ? Sohom (talk) 12:45, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Everyone always has to apply for user rights; this one is no different. The only rights granted automatically are auto and extended confirmed. Given that WMF legal wrote this policy and it's intended to comply with GDPR amongst other laws, I doubt this will change. voorts (talk/contributions) 16:00, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
@Voorts MediaWiki rights (for example, edituserjson as opposed to groups WP:INTADMIN) are typically bundle-able (and the norm is to allow for them to be bundled together for related activities). I don't particularly mind that this isn't allowed tho. What I'm asking for is primarily public documentation and reasoning for why this is the case. (That being said, based on some offwiki conversation I have had, I now have a better idea now of why the policy is what it is) Sohom (talk) 22:40, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Regardless of whether it's okay to bundle, we should probably start setting up WP:Requests for permissions/Temporary account IP viewers now, since admins are already able to grant this via Special:UserRights. We'll need to hash out whether we want to impose any additional local requirements or keep the global minimums (300 edits + 6 months). Mz7 (talk) 20:57, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
The top of the policy also notes that editors need to agree to abide by them: "As a condition of access, users who have not agreed to the Access to nonpublic personal data policy must agree to the following guidelines." voorts (talk/contributions) 21:30, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
If memory serves, the plan was to have that agreement enforced with/documented through clickwrap. WhatamIdoing (talk) 02:33, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
@Sohom Datta I think notifications to WP:AN and NPP talk page (not sure where RBers gather to discuss matters) would be prudent as this change may affect workloads of these group of editors at the very least. – robertsky (talk) 17:11, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Notified! Sohom (talk) 19:05, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
I see the benefit for NPP, in that they may have to figure out if various temporary accounts are the same person and IP addresses may help with that. However, I am not seeing as clear a link to rollback. Rollback is essentially a way to simplify reversions, while digging into IP data is sounds like it complicates vandal-reversion. CMD (talk) 02:38, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Rollback often correlates with anti-vandalism work. For example, one of the best anti-vandalism tools, WP:HUGGLE, requires the rollback permission to use. –Novem Linguae (talk) 05:10, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Right, but what particularly does viewing IPs add to that? We should have a clear reason for bundling. CMD (talk) 06:58, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Things like checking if an IP is in the same city as another one, if an IP is from a proxy, or all changes from a certain range like /64. I commonly use various online IP tools when I do anti-vandalism work, losing that ability wouldn't be nice. win8x (talk) 12:37, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Temporary accounts will be browser-based. Using a different browser on same device, or clearing the history and starting over again will each create a new temporary account. So, you could act like multiple different persons with minimal effort even on the same IP/device/browser. For those involved in anti-vandal work, it will be essential to check if they all come from the same source or not. —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X}) 02:22, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Temporary accounts (i.e. IP editors in old money) will not be able to create new pages, right? So how would this be useful to NPP? – Joe (talk) 12:32, 11 June 2025 (UTC)


=== Proposed requirements for temporary account IP addresses user right ===
The minimum requirements per the access policy are:

minimum account age of 6 months and 300 edits;
applying for access;
opting in for access via Special:Preferences; and
"[a]gree[ing] to use the IP addresses in accordance with these guidelines, solely for the investigation or prevention of vandalism, abuse, or other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies, and understand[ing] the risks and responsibilities associated with this privilege".
I propose that we maintain the minimum requirements, and add a requirement that editors show a need for access. I also propose that we up the minimum requirements for NPP and rollback to match this right and make editors apply for this right simultaneously (and that we consider having those rights as showing a need for access). voorts (talk/contributions) 21:46, 8 June 2025 (UTC)

Support - I'm up for these requirement (until we figure out if we can bundle temporary account IP addresses into the rights). Sohom (talk) 23:25, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Ummmm We should not force someone that wants to do anti-vandalism to also be required to apply for 2 additional groups that they may not want. — xaosflux Talk 23:45, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Also #3, #4 are already built in to the interface - we don't need to require that. #1 is already the minimum, so this is making the local requirement be "ask for it"??? — xaosflux Talk 23:46, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
1-4 are all of the requirements, as the line immediately preceding that list notes: The minimum requirements per the access policy are. My suggestion is that editors applying for this right independently should also have to explain how they would use the right, but I guess that's a necessary part of submitting in application. voorts (talk/contributions) 23:51, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
OK, so the only part for the local project to decide is if we want more than 6/300, or additional requirements. As far as "show a need for access" being a local requirement, do you have a proposed test for this - or just if you can convince any admin you have a need? — xaosflux Talk 00:36, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Convincing an admin that you have a need would be fine. That's part of why I proposed bundling it with NPP/rollback; both of those groups will generally have a need for the right. voorts (talk/contributions) 00:39, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
I wasn't suggesting that RB should be required to apply for NPP or vice versa. I was suggesting that NPP and RB should meet the same requirements and we should just give the temp-IP right when we give out those other two rights. voorts (talk/contributions) 23:49, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Support: Sounds good, but I highly prefer bundling it with NPP and rollback as well. Once this rolls out completely, figuring out abuse by multiple anonymous editors will become extremely more difficult that it already is with IP ranges. Regardless, I think we can trust holders of NPP and rollback to have access to IP data, if we can trust them with reviewing new pages and mass reverting edits respectively. ~/Bunnypranav:<ping> 04:04, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
I have no problem with bundling it as per Bunny, provided there is no room for discretionary variance below the 90 day threshold under WP:NPRCRITERIA. Currently, the guidelines for granting say "90 days" registration is "generally speaking" a prerequisite; if we bundle, this should be made a hard minimum to ensure logged IP data has eclipsed before a potentially malevolent new account was able to register and attain access to masked address information. Chetsford (talk) 14:28, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
It would have to be upped to 6 months, per Foundation requirements. voorts (talk/contributions) 14:33, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Oh yes, you're right, I misread. That remedies my concern, in that case. Chetsford (talk) 14:37, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Support minimum requirement as stated with RfP/Temporary account IP viewers page for #2. Oppose bundling with NPP or rollbacker. My point of view is that rollbacker is (or at least it was when I first started out) a relatively easy right to get to help new editors to demonstrate that they can on more rights and responsibilities before moving on to other user rights, while those who are interested in NPP may not be interested in doing anti-vandalism work. – robertsky (talk) 14:43, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Those are fair points. I'm not wedded to bundling the rights. voorts (talk/contributions) 15:40, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
A rollbacker without the see IP permission would be effectively toothless and while NPP folks don't strictly do anti-vandalism, there are scenarios (for example overturned BLARs, AFC drafts or repeatedly recreated page where it makes sense for folks to have access to IP data) Sohom (talk) 16:15, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
not toothless, just troublesome in a couple of scenarios. – robertsky (talk) 17:00, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
@Robertsky NPP work sometimes also occasionally requires looking at the creator the articles, and now with temp accounts, a potential sock masters life has become very easy to create similar multiple problematic articles if one gets deleted. If NPR has access to IP data, it should be much easier to spot such attempts (of course creating multiple actual accounts is a thing, but I don't think we should make sock masters' life any easier.)
Regarding rollback, yes I agree it may make it a bit harder, but what is the general edit count when people get rollback? Guidelines state 200 as a suggestion, but I don't think many people can come up to the activity level of RB before passing 200. (I don't have any data, this is just my assumption) ~/Bunnypranav:<ping> 16:15, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
If a pattern of similar multiple problematic articles can be established even without the IP address access, is there really a need? Likewise for repeated BLARs or repeated recreations. Isn't it the same as us assessing multiple newly registered accounts doing the same thing? – robertsky (talk) 16:55, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
I'm assuming WP:ACPERM still applies (i.e., we won't grant temporary accounts autoconfirmed status) so I don't really see the utility of this for NPP. I'll apply for it if I'm made to, of course, but I don't really see myself using it much. Alpha3031 (t • c) 04:04, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Also bundling the rights will require revocation requirements (1 year of inactivity) to be added if there is none. (It is a positive. Just a reminder.) – robertsky (talk) 16:59, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Support. Maybe to alleviate concerns temporary (trial run) granting of these right don't include this new userright, but once its indef granted, then its bundled in? I'd be okay with it either way personally. JackFromWisconsin (talk | contribs) 16:27, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Oppose and just turn off IP editing --Guerillero Parlez Moi 19:11, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
@Guerillero, care to explain further why you oppose this change ? (Outside of IDONTLIKEIT opposition of a feature mandated by GDPR ?) Sohom (talk) 19:21, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
GDPR has been around for close to a decade now; IP masking, as I understand it, is more about the fear of future legislation rather than current policies. We have a clear third option, follow other projects and turn off IP editing, instead of creating additional levels of bureaucracy. -- Guerillero Parlez Moi 19:31, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Even TVTropes requires sign-in-to-edit. But way back when this was repeatedly proposed, the WMF repeatedly said "not just no, but snook no". Maybe they've changed in the last decade or so but trust me, a large number of editors have wanted SITE for a long time, and it hasn't happened; it's unlikely to happen now, for better or for worse. - The Bushranger One ping only 23:01, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Comment I'm an active NPP'er and also a rollbacker (which I seldom find to be useful and rarely use).   Also it would not be too hard for a  government / agency that wants to investigate posts by a temporary account to get NPP rights which also defeat one of the purposes of temporary accounts and thus also give a false sense of security to temporary accounts in which case the temporary account might do more harm than good. I think that granting it to all rollbackers is an even lower bar making those problems even worse. Sincerely, North8000 (talk) 19:53, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Also it would not be too hard for a government / agency that wants to investigate posts by a temporary account to get NPP rights which also defeat one of the purposes of temporary accounts They would also be able to apply for the IP right outside of those things, so I'm not quite sure why that's a relevant consideration.I think that granting it to all rollbackers is an even lower bar As noted above, the minimum requirements for this particular right (as set by WMF legal) is 300 edits + 6 months with an account, and as noted, bundling the right with rollback would require increasing the requirement for rollback. voorts (talk/contributions) 20:44, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Support bundling the application process for NPP and rollback with the temporary account addresses user right. Make granting of NPP or rollback contingent on being eligible and granted the account addresses user right. We should make this coupling of the two applications as simple as possible for applicants--that's where I'm struggling a bit. For current NPP/rollbackers, require application for temp account addresses right as soon as their account meets the requirements. Suspend NPP/rollbacking right on those accounts whose users are eligible for and do not successfully apply for the addresses user right. Consider suspending NPP/rollbacking right on those accounts ineligible for the addresses user right. Take headache relievers consistently, as I see a giant migraine coming on with these changes and the complications herein. — rsjaffe 🗣️ 01:51, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Note the use of the word "suspend". As soon as a user with a suspended NPP/rollbacking right that is suspended due to not having addresses right successfully receives addresses right, the linked NPP/rollbacking right would be reinstated without need for a new application. — rsjaffe 🗣️ 01:54, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
The "minimum account age of 6 months and 300 edits" provides to some extent another automatic user right layer (give or take the applying system), it would be better to align it as much as possible with existing rights. In this case, it perhaps should line up with the WP:EXTENDED right as much as possible, ie. 6 months and 500 edits. CMD (talk) 02:43, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Support for NPP, oppose for rollback. I don't get the arguments here that rollbackers are "toothless" without the ability to view IPs -- rollback is supposed to apply to edits that are obviously unconstructive. If you need to investigate someone's IP address to determine whether an edit is unconstructive then it isn't obvious. Gnomingstuff (talk) 04:43, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Strong Support for Rollback & Support for NPP. It's a bit obvious that vandalism fighters may require this right to check if two different vandal accounts are actually used by same person. Ɔþʱʏɾɪʊs⚔ 07:46, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Strong oppose bundling with either NPP or rollback; a decision to double or triple the experience level for a user group should be done on its own merits, not snuck in as a technical criterion, and this would cause the NPP backlog to explode. And I'm not convinced by Sohom Datta's claims, especially since logged-out users can't even create articles so it should be completely orthogonal to NPP status. And while he has more of a point for rollbacker; people of all levels of experience will patrol vandalism and while it may be more effective with temp account access there's no reason whatsoever to forcibly prohibit people who don't meet the temp account view criteria from using Huggle, for example. If specific people find that this access would be helpful, they can request it. * Pppery * it has begun... 16:11, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Oppose mandatory bundling. We may have editors who don't want this permission but want to be able to patrol new pages/redirects and/or have rollback. Updating the instructions, once the masking is live here, to encourage editors applying for NPP or rollback who meet the 6/300 requirement to also ask for it as part of the request could be useful. Or admins suggesting it as part of the process of reviewing the permission requests for NPP and rollback if they feel the editor would be a good one to have that additional tool. Skynxnex (talk) 21:39, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Comment: Since this discussion involves changing policy, a well-advertised RfC would be required. I've proposed something below. voorts (talk/contributions) 01:05, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
In T388320 (not publicly accessable), I pointed out what I believed to be a serious flaw in the Temporary Account system which could lead to significant leakage of personal information (in excess of what we have now with IP edits).  One of the things I argued for in that ticket is requiring the TA user right to be explicitly granted, and I'm glad that this was done.  So I'm firmly in opposition to any attempt to walk that back.
As for granting this to all NPP and RB holders, consider that when those rights were granted to people, the granting admin evaluated whether they trusted the user to use the particular powers being granted.  To say that "Because some admin last year thought you wouldn't abuse rollback, we're now going to automatically add in some other unrelated right which will allow you to do far more dangerous things" seems absurd.  If you want the TA IP viewer bit, ask for it.  I don't imagine there will be a very high bar to giving it out, but keeping a human in the permission granting loop is essential. RoySmith (talk) 16:08, 12 June 2025 (UTC)


=== Revocation of rights ===
Does anyone know if the requirement to make an edit or perform a logged action is enforced automatically by the MediaWiki software? That is, if you have been inactive for 365 days, you won't have access even if you hold the right by virtue of your group memberships? isaacl (talk) 01:44, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Even if it is not removed automatically, we can deal with it manually like we do for some rights, like adminstrators, autopatrollers, etc. Although preferably there should be a way to autoexpire the user group membership given that it is a Foundation-mandated requirement. However, from the way I read the access policy, we should also take into account that local community consensus can be achieved to increase the minimum threhold for retention. If [sic] local community consensus dictates removal, then stewards or local administrators and bureaucrats are authorized to terminate access. – robertsky (talk) 14:14, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Sure. I asked because I think that affects the decision to bundle the right with an existing group. If I understand correctly, this wouldn't be feasible if we need to manually remove access from those who have been inactive for a year. Alternatively, the groups would need to have the same inactivity requirements (in addition to the criteria listed in the "Proposed requirements" section, in which my comment was originally placed). isaacl (talk) 16:48, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
NPP has 1 year inactivity requirement. Rollback does not have any. It is feasible to do so manually. If I am not mistaken, there are admins who have been tracking which accounts to remove which rights. I don't work in this venue often, so correct me if I am wrong. I took the liberty to break it out to a separate section as your question was at the same indent level and the newer entries are getting disjointed. Feel free to move back indent accordingly. – robertsky (talk) 17:07, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes, I agreed it is feasible to manage manually if the group itself has a matching activity requirement. It's something that would have to be added to the requirements to continue to hold the rollback right, and then the tracking process implemented. (If the answer to my initial question is "yes", then of course this extra work can be skipped.) Thanks for adding the note regarding the additional requirement to the "Proposed requirements" section. isaacl (talk) 17:34, 9 June 2025 (UTC)


=== Right criteria and functions ===
So, the comment by Pppery has made me think about this. I feel that a separate right should be made. I am proposing a separate right, TAIV(obviously an acronym). The following would be criteria and functions. We can discuss the changes & improve it per consensus. 


==== Criteria ====
The editor should be a registered Wikipedia user who has been editing for 6 months.
The editor should have made at least 300 overall edits with 200 edits in the mainspace.
The editor should have no behavioral blocks (including partial blocks) or 3RR violations for a span of 6 months prior to applying.
The editor should have shown experience in patrolling vandalism or new pages.
Also, if consensus reached the the (rollbacker) or/& (reviewer) can be included. Cheers!

This discussions is about a new userright that WMF is rolling out. Did you read the policy I linked to? voorts (talk/contributions) 17:59, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
@Voorts I know that it's from the WMF policy & not your criteria. I said "The 4th criteria by voorts" to quickly clarify that 4th principal from that criteria is being referred. Ɔþʱʏɾɪʊs⚔ 04:24, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
The comment from NKohli (WMF) indicates that the right cannot be bundled with an existing group, since access to it must be requested individually. Unless that viewpoint changes, then there has to be a separate group. isaacl (talk) 18:02, 10 June 2025 (UTC)

My proposal is that we tie together the application process, so both groups are applied for at the same time. Each application is evaluated separately, but the NPP/Rollback application approval is predicated upon the IP addresses approval. This is administrative simplification of the two applications, not a bundling of the groups. — rsjaffe 🗣️ 18:10, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
I was responding to Ophyrius's proposal. In essence a new group is the only way to go if the right can't be bundled. The community can of course set more stringent criteria if it wishes. isaacl (talk) 00:44, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
We can make people apply for the new right if they apply for NPP/rollback. What we can't do is automatically give the right to all current editors with NPP/rollback unless they separately apply. voorts (talk/contributions) 18:10, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Is there really a need to require everyone who applies for NPR or Rollback to also apply for TA IP viewer right? I don't see how this is critical to the function of those and can't be separate, even if IPs are not going to be available to NPRs/rollbackers without the right, that doesn't affect the process of reverting vandalism or reviewing pages severely. Moreover, I imagine this would significantly affect the majority of valid requests at WP:PERM/R and WP:PERM/NPR to a lesser extent. Tenshi! (Talk page) 19:13, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Sure; that's something different than Ophyrius's proposal. I think I agree with Tenshi Hinanawi though—I think editors should be able to request the rights separately, depending on their interest. As per rsjaffe, the request process can be unified so applicants can request all rights in which they are interested at once. isaacl (talk) 00:44, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
@Isaacl: Well, per Mz7, I support a separate perm page for Taiv. As for the comment by @Tenshi Hinanawi:, I believe that existing rollbackers/Vandalism fighters, should receive this tool as it would help by checking if 2 IPs are of same range/ used by sane user and what to be reported. Ɔþʱʏɾɪʊs⚔ 04:42, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Sure, it can be useful, but I don't believe it should be at the expense of being required to wait 4-5 more months as a new user so you can have both Rollback and TA IP viewer at the same time when you only want Rollback, likewise with NPR. — Tenshi! (Talk page) 17:48, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes, that's why TAIV should be a separate usergroup that has rollback & reviewer bundled with it (if consensus reached) rather than it being bundled with others. Ɔþʱʏɾɪʊs⚔ 15:38, 12 June 2025 (UTC)


=== RfC proposal ===
This is a proposal. Please do not !vote. Are there any suggestions for changes?
Background: The WMF is removing public access to IP addresses and replacing them with temporary accounts. The WMF has also created a new user right for access to temporary account IP addresses. The minimum criteria for that user right are:

minimum account age of 6 months and 300 edits;
applying for access;
opting in for access via Special:Preferences; and
"[a]gree[ing] to use the IP addresses in accordance with these guidelines, solely for the investigation or prevention of vandalism, abuse, or other violations of Wikimedia Foundation or community policies, and understand[ing] the risks and responsibilities associated with this privilege".
Question 1: What should the minimum account age and edit count be?
Option A: 6 months/300 edits
Option B: 6 months/500 edits
Option C: Something else
Question 2: Should we adopt additional requirements, such as a specified time period without blocks/bans prior to requesting the right, experience with counter-vandalism work, knowledge of relevant policies and guidelines, etc.?
Question 3: Should receiving patroller or rollback be contingent upon receiving the access to temporary account IP addresses user right? voorts (talk/contributions) 01:02, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

Question 2 is fairly open-ended. Maybe that should be discussed separately so that concrete options can be provided for an RfC. voorts (talk/contributions) 01:04, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Question 3 isn't really a binary, the options I think may be plausibly supported are:
All three rights come as a bundle - everyone who has one has them all
All three have the same requirements, but they are independent rights and an editor may have any combination
All three have the same requirements, but only NPP is bundled with IP viewer, rollback remains independent
All three have the same requirements, but only rollback is bundled with IP viewer, NPP remains independent
Rollback is bundled with IP viewer, NPP remains independent and the requirements for it are unchanged
NPP is bundled with IP viewer, rollback remains independent and the requirements for it are unchanged
No change to the status quo.
If anyone wants to bundle NPP and rollback but not IPviewer, with or without changes to the requirements, then I think that should be proposed separately. Thryduulf (talk) 01:58, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
why make it complicated? Let's just treat it as a standalone user group like we do for all the other user groups, and at the most, word the RfP pages that those who are requesting for NPP or RB may want to request for TAIV separately. – robertsky (talk) 05:03, 11 June 2025 (UTC)


==== Question 2 Discussion ====
I've taken up Voorts' musing about Q2 and separated it out for discussion.
My first question is: what are the risks of handing out the privilege? Are there any high-risk scenarios? If not, I don't see a need for further restrictions. If yes, I'd like to see a restriction that weeds out applicants that would be more likely involved in the high-risk scenario.
I'm having trouble coming up with a high-risk scenario. Am I missing something? — rsjaffe 🗣️ 01:14, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I agree with this question. It's hard to discuss what potential extra measures may be warranted/necessary without considering specific problems that are foreseen. I think it would be worse to make the criteria unnecessarily high, as it would potentially prevent users who would benefit from the access from having it, and if history tells, it's much less likely for the requirements to be lowered in the future.My initial thought is this: the WMF is doing this for two potential reasons - to increase anonymity, and potentially to stall or prevent future legal concerns over the information being publicized. If the WMF felt higher access requirements were necessary to meet those goals, they would've required it when allowing the information to be accessed by editors other than Checkusers. Since they did not, it suggests that there is not any need for additional restrictions. In other words, beyond the restrictions the WMF is requiring, why should we not maintain the status quo for decades that users can view the IP information of users without an account? -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:22, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I've been musing on some potential ways to improve this question. I think it should be simpler - While the requirements above are the minimum we can adopt per the WMF, we can also adopt additional requirements if we choose. What other considerations (not specific criteria) would you support being had to permit someone to apply for and/or receive this role? - with the specific criteria to be worked out later. In other words, basically make this two steps - first is there a consensus for any individual consideration to be made into a criteria, and then work out that extra criteria. For example, people may support "some level of antivandalism work" and also support "recent activity" - but they may not support a criteria of "has made at least 10 anti-vandalism reversions in the past 6 months". I think it's going to get very unwieldy very fast if we are all allowed to just propose whatever other specific criteria we think fit, and it will become difficult, if not impossible, to find consensus for any of them. Hence why I think this needs to be the "ask the community for the scenarios they want to see addressed" question, and then the "what should the specific criteria (singular or plural) be that best addresses these concerns" at a later date. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:41, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I agree with you. I think apart from the minimum requirement, the rest should be open for administrator's discretion. They'll obviously make sure that a malicious actor not hold the right. —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X}) 02:58, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I think the question should be Option A: Peg to the minimum criteria as required by WMF, then B1, B2... exploring higher restrictions. —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X}) 02:57, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
This would be better than the current, imo. But I worry it will become unwieldy with B1 - 100 edits in past 6 months, B2 - 200 edits in past 6 months, B3 - 100 edits in past 12 months, C1 - 10 anti-vandalism/patrolling edits in past 6 months, C2 - must be "active" in anti-vandal work (without being defined), C3 - must show activity in new page patrolling, D1 - should not be actively blocked or banned at all (including topic bans)... etc, etc. That's why I think gauging community consensus on some requirement (for each "category") before workshopping the specific requirement is likely better. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 19:41, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I wonder how much blocks and bans restrict the ability to view IP logs ? I think it would definitely make sense to restrict the right to users in good standing potentially with a requirement for 6 months of activity without blocks or bans. (partially because the ability to view temporary account IPs enhances your ability to ban evade in the first place) Sohom (talk) 16:35, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Per wmf:Trust and Safety Product/Temporary Accounts/FAQ, sitewide blocked users cannot access the information, though those with partial block(s) only still can. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 19:36, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Do we really need to spell out that editors who have active blocks/bans shouldn't receive the user right? That seems obvious to me and I don't think other user right guidelines explicitly say that. voorts (talk/contributions) 19:48, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I think Sohom may be getting at an automatic removal if someone is blocked/banned after already having the right, since the technical limitation only prevents a sitewide blocked user (or, I guess, a globally locked user since they can't log in) from accessing the info. For example, a topic banned user with 5 p-blocks from various talk pages would still be able to access the info from their main account if they had the userright. As a comparison, WP:ROLLBACK and WP:PERM/R make no mention of not assigning it to someone with blocks/bans, nor of whether it should be (or must be) automatically removed if someone is p-blocked/topic banned/etc. I don't know if that is standard process or not, but it should probably be explicitly stated. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 19:53, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
What @Berchanhimez said, I think we are a fair bit more open to giving folks rollback than we should be with CU-TA which will be able to give folks a leg up in AE areas (which is where a lot of topic bans, i-bans and p-blocks come from in the first place). I think making it explicit that any block or ban preclude folks from receiving the right is a good line in the sand to draw to point out that CU-TA will require a higher level of trust. Sohom (talk) 21:56, 11 June 2025 (UTC)


==== Question 3 discussion ====
I think the key question to discuss is whether or not the checkuser-temporary-account right is a necessary prerequisite for new page patrol, or for rolling back edits. (I know that the rollback right is used to provide access to certain tools, but editors can still request it solely for making rollback simpler, by some measure.) I think answering this will answer whether or not being approved for checkuser-temporary-account right should be a necessary requirement to be approved for new page patrol or rollback. isaacl (talk) 02:20, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

I'm interested to see thoughts on this, because as you say there are use cases for the other rights that wouldn't require or even benefit from having this access. I wouldn't support this basically becoming a "new criteria" to get one of those rights if it's not absolutely necessary for the use of those rights. For example, the WMF isn't even requiring administrators to opt in to this - which suggests that this is not necessary for those (or any) part of the admin toolkit. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:25, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
This section is for discussing the RfC and its framing, not continuing to discuss the merits of the issue. voorts (talk/contributions) 02:30, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I think this is very important to the framing though. The question needs to be worded in a way that it's clear what it's proposing. My best idea is to change it to something like Do any other advanced rights that can currently be assigned (such as rollback or patroller) require access to temporary account IP addresses to perform those roles? If not, should access to this user right still be required to be considered for access to those roles? The problem is that this doesn't break out any roles individually. But it makes clear that A -> B, but that we could also decide to do B even without A, if there's a good reason for it. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:36, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Regarding this point and your response RE question 2 above, if we're going that broad, I think that a workshop is more appropriate than an RfC. voorts (talk/contributions) 02:45, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I thought that's what we were doing here was workshopping the potential RfC. If, on the other hand, you're suggesting that a more full/structured workshop would be necessary for those questions, I would tend to agree - I don't particularly care whether it happens before or after an RfC, but I do think that my proposed questions would allow the RfC to gauge consensus for some roles (ex: there may be a consensus that administrators must be able to be trusted with this role, even if they don't want/use it) and more clearly show which (if any) others should have further discussion. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 19:23, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I think the original question was to give TAIV to everyone who has RB/NPP (TAIV dependent on RB/NPP). This proposed question fundamentally reverses the original question, it makes RB/NPP dependent on TAIV. —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X}) 03:06, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Whether the right is a necessary prerequisite for NPP or rollback is the same question as whether or not being approved for [the] right should be a necessary requirement for NPP or rollback. voorts (talk/contributions) 02:25, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I think the framing is important, to put emphasis on the different scopes of tasks that different volunteers undertake. I'm not sure everyone considers these two questions equivalent (even if we do). isaacl (talk) 02:29, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
A prerequisite and a requirement are definitionally the same. voorts (talk/contributions) 02:32, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
The difference I intended is that the current question 3 is written from an approval process perspective, while my question is about the workflows of new page patrollers or rollbackers. As I think the answer to question 3 is a direct consequence of the answer about the workflows, my personal preference is to just directly ask the workflow question. But I appreciate that it's likely most people will consider the underlying question. isaacl (talk) 02:42, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Well, if rollback and reviewer is combined with Taiv, it will be better as Rollback & reviewer are almost used together by everyone. It'll be helpful against vandalism. Also, most of the patrollers are also rollbackers. Since, IPs can't create pages the Taiv isn't that much required for NPP as I have never seen an IP being revealed of a sock or it's sockpuppeteer. Ɔþʱʏɾɪʊs⚔ 04:33, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Peeps regularly edit logged out to perform bad-hand-good-hand sockpuppetry. Also, as I mentioned somewhere, NPP folks regularly deal with un-BLARing and have the ability to approve AFC drafts both of which often require knowing about IP ranging (I know a particular Ipv6 range really used to like unblarring CASTE articles). Sohom (talk) 16:38, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Actually, that raises a interesting question, could AFC reviewing (without NPP) seen as a "demonstration of need" ? Sohom (talk) 16:39, 11 June 2025 (UTC)


==== General discussion ====
Note the new right also requires that the user make an edit or a logged action in the last 365 days in order to retain the right. This should be listed as one of the minimum requirements. isaacl (talk) 02:05, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

That's a reason for revoking the right, not a requirement to grant it. An editor doesn't have to use the right once granted, but if they don't use it once per year, they lose it. voorts (talk/contributions) 02:27, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
My reading of the policy page is that they do not ever have to use the right - they simply can't have been wholly inactive (no edit or logged action in any log) for a year and keep it. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:29, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I think it would be helpful to mention, though, so people can keep it in mind when considering if holding the right should be a requirement to be a rollbacker. (My understanding is also that its an activity requirement, not a requirement to use the right occasionally.) isaacl (talk) 02:45, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Will viewing an IP address be a logged action? CMD (talk) 07:09, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
A logged action is any action that appears in Special:Log. Revealing the IP address of a temporary account is logged, according to foundation:Policy:Wikimedia Access to Temporary Account IP Addresses Policy § Use of temporary account IP addresses. isaacl (talk) 19:19, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
The MW page has too much information that could be overwhelming for the average RfC participant. The RfC should include the most important points about how temporary accounts differ from current IP system in one or two paragraphs, because I do think that most people do not know the differences. Thanks! —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X}) 02:31, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

Hey everyone, I wanted to share that I'm reading the discussion, but I'm not active here because the discussions on wikis where we may/will deploy later this month take precedence. Other people on the team also focus on work needed to be wrapped before these deployments. But in July, we should be more available for you. Thanks for understanding.
Secondly, I've just created a page mw:Trust and Safety Product/Temporary Accounts/Access to IP, where I'm basically combining different pieces of documentation related more or less directly to access to temp account IP addresses. I hope this page will be useful, and I welcome your comments on it. Thanks! 🖖 SGrabarczuk (WMF) (talk) 23:49, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Thank you for this, it was definitely useful. I can think of a few things that may need to be covered in the help page:
1. Global abuse-filter-manager and abuse-filter-helper are entrusted with TAIV by default, are the local EFMs and EFHs not covered or is it a mistake?
2. If someone begins a browser session on an IP, and later changes the IP, will it create a new TA or the old TA be updated with later IP?
3. When IPs get blocked, will the log and block reason be visible to non-TAIVs?
4. Will a block on an IP to restrict only the temporary accounts also restrict access to permanent accounts on that range?
5. Will users who voluntarily uncheck the Special:Prefs setting to remove TAIV need to request an admin to return the right to get it back, or re-checking the setting will enable it? If the latter, what if they became inactive (no edits/logs in 1 year) post-removal of TAIV?
Thanks! —CX Zoom[he/him] (let's talk • {C•X}) 00:25, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

So, I just happened to chance upon the end of an AfD on a certain forked list, which, incidentally seemed to be created a couple of days after a suggestion that I think may have been misinterpreted (as an aside, I think a takeaway here could be that one should be possibly excessively specific when suggesting to new users they create an article). In any case, this seems to be a dispute that has been something that pops up every so often (see, RfC on the idea 3 years ago and the rest of that archive page for that matter). As Fram mentions, we do have a number of various GDP lists, of which the per capita lists (nominal, PPP) notably have had the EU included (I haven't checked the history or the other lists or anything). While I don't think another RfC would actually settle things for good, I feel like it might be worth a try to decide on a consistent format, for example, always excluding entirely, creating the series as part of a separate "supranationals" page, including in a separate section. Alpha3031 (t • c) 16:42, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

The TL;DR is I suppose I'd like to solicit opinions on what the best way to represent supranational bodies in these financial lists is, so that we can have some best practices to refer to. This specific discussion being a bit of a pre-RfC discussion to workshop potential options, form and scope, etc. Alpha3031 (t • c) 16:48, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
The EU is a unique political structure, not easy to compare to other supranational bodies, and simplifying the question to including it alongside a hodgepodge of other supranational bodies, which are not monolithic with relevance to GDP either would not be beneficial. As for a wider scope, it would be premised on the idea that the inclusion criteria of every GDP-related list is the same, which I wouldn't take as a given. CMD (talk) 16:50, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Why restrict this to GDP lists? If the source we're using for a list of countries by X includes one or more supranational unions then it seems to make sense to include it/them in the list. If the source doesn't include any such entities, then obviously our lists shouldn't either.
List of countries by total fertility rate#Country ranking by most recent year includes several different groupings and a quick scan of the talk page suggests this is uncontroversial. Thryduulf (talk) 16:55, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
I'm looking at GDP lists mostly because that was the dispute that ended up at AfD. There are also apparently some pretty weirdly written lists in there (e.g. List of countries by GDP sector composition, with multiple changing criteria in each of the sublists) Also, I just realised I posted this at WP:VPP instead of WP:VPR where I was meaning to... oops? Probably should not have done this as the last thing in my day. I do agree, re CMD, that the EU could be seen very differently from most other supranational bodies or regions, which means that (assuming I/we don't end up deciding to drop one or the other) it might need to be an RFC with two (or more) sections... I'd definitely want to spend some time on workshoping so it doesn't end up being a mess. Alpha3031 (t • c) 17:04, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

This recently was an issue of discuss at WT:ITN but appears representative of a larger scale lack of consistency, in how we are expecting the sourcing in a list of works for a biographical subject to be presented for a quality article when it comes to processes like ITN and other main page items as well as FA/GA. 
For ITN, when we have recent deaths, many creative persons that are nominated on their death have what's been considered substandard because their filmography or discography or other list of works lack sourcing for most of the entries. This generally prevents the death from being included on the Recent Death line (recent example Guy Klucevsek), and has been a point of consternation at the talk page because it seems too impermissive for many bio articles. But then today, with Brian Wilson's death, it was noticed by one user after it was posted that the list of works there too lacked sourcing, and it was likely posted too quickly to be noticed given the rest of the article appeared to be in good shape. (Since its posting someone has been searching to fill out the necessary refs for the filmography). And then it was pointed out in the same discussion that today's FA, Mariah Carey, which was reviewed as a FA in Dec 2024, also lacks sources for the list of works, both on her bio page and on the separate list of work pages. So clearly the entire project doesn't seem on board with what seems to be the appropriate level of sourcing that should be applied to lists of works.
The one place where there is some advice is at MOS:LISTOFWORKS which says Complete lists of works, appropriately sourced to reliable scholarship (WP:V), are encouraged, particularly when such lists are not already freely available on the internet. If the list has a separate article, a simplified version should also be provided in the main article. The word "encouraged" is a far cry from "required" so its hard to say that the MOS forces this. One could also add BLP and WP:V here, where removal of unsourced information is generally encouraged, but that usually is reserved for contentious content and not things that are likely factually true but just need a source.
Note that I am only focusing on what we are considering to be quality articles, and not articles in progress. Ideally, editors will improve biographies to meet what is determined to be the expected quality prior to taking an article to GA/FA or any other process that requires a quality article, but until the GA/FA or other process is actually started, these can still be considered works in progress and we should not be trying too hard to force such corrections.
So there's a potential RFC here, but I don't know what the framing is. Right now, I think its best to ask this in several questions to determine what the next steps are, if an RFC is even needed or what question(s) it might need to be about (Using subsections so each point can be addressed). If you think there are additional questions to these, please feel free to add them as a separate subsection. Masem (t) 00:40, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

=== Does each item in a list of works need to be sourced? ===
Does each item in a list of works need to be sourced? (See next question as to what qualifies as a source). Note that I would consider a single reliable source that supports the bulk of the list to be acceptable for use as a header line into such a list or table (eg text like "Unless otherwise noted, sourcing for works is based on this source."), so that we aren't repeating one source 40 or 50 times over, but satisfying the need to source each work. --Masem (t) 00:40, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

Thanks Masem for starting this discussion. Since I first raised this issue a year ago, I've changed my stance. I'm now more of the school that for the vast bulk of uncontentious items in a list of published works we do not need a source. To quote Chubbles: A published work proves its own existence. It is a strange irony that we can use an album to verify the details of a song or songs (for example see List of songs recorded by Kylie Minogue or The Queen is Dead) but would require a source to verify the album itself on a different list of works. Since that discussion a year ago, I've had this wording saved as a possible start point for changed guidelines at MOS:LISTOFWORKS:
In general, a published work verifies its own existence and therefore an inline citation is not necessary for basic information in lists of works. To allow for easy verification, editors should provide as much identifying information for the work as possible such as year of publication, publisher, ISBN or record catalogue number. Manuscripts, obscure publications or limited editions which are not widely available in libraries or catalogues may benefit from a reliable source for verification. For additional information that is not found in the published work itself such as sales numbers, awards, uncredited appearances or other details that are likely to be challenged, an inline citation to a reliable source is appropriate.
Feel free to rip this to shreds. Vladimir.copic (talk) 06:48, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
That quote seems to conflict with WP:External links § How to link, which calls for a bare [foo] or [foo bar] link rather than details. -- Shmuel (Seymour J.) Metz Username:Chatul (talk) 07:11, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
ISBNs work for books, because they can be linked to {{ISBN}}, which leads to a database where the source's existence can be verified.  Would audio/video sources use something like {{Cite AV media}}, and would providing one of  the identifier parameters provide something similar?  A non-subject matter expert should be able to verify that, yes, this work was produced by this person. For comparison, a sports bio is not allowed to assume that a reader knows where to go to verify a player's unsourced statistics, and a link under "External links" is not accepted. —Bagumba (talk) 07:37, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
Re record catalogue numbers: these seem to be a rarity for musician articles. In fact, usually swept away if they appear in infoboxes. Currently ITN/RD postings are often held up by demands for every record to be supported by a WP:RS source i.e. discogs.com not allowed. Martinevans123 (talk) 08:41, 13 June 2025 (UTC)
Each item should be cited. In my experience, bulk citations do not tend to earn the presumption that they support the bulk of the list (to say nothing of what threshold indicates "the bulk"). The other thing is that the list can grow after the citation is added, with no review whatsoever as to if the works are cited. I would personally put the threshold for ITN at something like 80%, and it is the rare single source that supports that much of a list. GreatCaesarsGhost 12:42, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
I don't think we should have to have an independent citation where authorship is verifiable from the work itself -- e.g. if someone is credited as an author on the cover of a book, or named in the cast in the credits of a film. Where there's some complicating factor (e.g. the work was published anonymously or pseudonymously), then we need a second source to mediate. This is in line with MOS:FICTION, where plot summaries of fictional works do not need independent citation, because it is reasonably assumed that they are cited to the work itself and make no claims other than those that can be verified using only that work.

I never understood how MOS:FICTION carved out that exemption.  I don't see football matches being allowed to be unsourced because there is game footage, or a political debate allowed to be sourced solely to video.  If I look at Wikipedia:WikiProject Books/Non-fiction article, it seems the ISBN would be, at a minimum, under release details. —Bagumba (talk) 07:20, 13 June 2025 (UTC)


=== What is considered an appropriate source? ===
Most of the time, we look to have a normally reliable source be the source to support an item on a list of works, like a biographic article or obituary. But we also allow for some unique cases, like for any published book, the ISBN number is usually sufficient, as from my understanding, because Wikicode makes this point to WorldCat which is considered an authority, and authorship is directly obvious from there. Same with most published journal articles with items like DOI numbers. But when we get to films, music, and other media forms, that type of database doesn't seem to exist. Eg: IMDB is not a reliable source for films despite that being the industry's standard per WP:IMDB and there is not anything professionally maintained like WorldCat. 
Related to that, for works that are independently notable (blue-linked), where the person's role is self-evident from the blue link, is that sufficient? By self-evident, we're talking the information you'd find on the proverbial cover - Its self-evident that Michael J Fox and Christropher Lloyd starred in Back to the Future II (it is spelled on the film's poster and the article lede), but you'd have to dig to say that Elijah Wood also was in the film, so that would not be a case of self-evidence for a blue-link. Is this appropriate for these self-evidence blue-likes (which can simply a lot of issues with these lists), or are we violating "Don't use Wikipedia itself as a citation" when we rely on blue links? --Masem (t) 00:40, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

Relying solely on the presence of a blue link is counter to WP:CIRCULAR: Do not use articles from Wikipedia (whether English Wikipedia or Wikipedias in other languages) as sources, since Wikipedia is a user-generated source ... Content from a Wikipedia article is not considered reliable unless it is backed up by citing reliable sources. Confirm that these sources support the content, then use them directly. —Bagumba (talk) 04:42, 12 June 2025 (UTC)


=== Does sourcing need to be in the main article for list of selected works if there's a separate, full list of works that is properly sourced? ===
If we have a separate list of works from the main bio article, should the main article have sourcing when selected works are repeated there? Similar to the above question, can we rely on the blue link to the full list of works, presumed to be properly sourced to the degree we expect, or should the selected works be sourced appropriately too, which often can be done just by reusing those sources? --Masem (t) 00:40, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

How is summary style handled, independent of whether it is a list of works?  I'm not aware that it is exempt from WP:CIRCULAR. —Bagumba (talk) 04:45, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
I am not aware of any summary style that is immune from sourcing requirements. EG: if I am summarizing a spin-off article in the one it originated from, I'm still bound to include the sources to support it. Which is why I think that in this scenario, sourcing from the split list needs to be reused in the main. Masem (t) 12:45, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
Yup… remember that Wikipedia is dynamic… articles can and do change.  So, while X might be mentioned (and cited) in “another article” today, future edits to that “other article” might result in X (and/or its citation) being removed. Thus, it is important to repeat the citation in every article where X is mentioned. Blueboar (talk) 13:07, 12 June 2025 (UTC)


=== Prior discussion and examples ===
There's an open discussion at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style/Lists of works#Are references required for lists of works?. Andrew🐉(talk) 06:06, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

That's a 2024 discussion, so it looks ok to start this here.  Feel free to note any significant points from there that are not already in the MOS. —Bagumba (talk) 06:26, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
