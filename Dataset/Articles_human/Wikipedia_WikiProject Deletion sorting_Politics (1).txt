This is a collection of discussions on the deletion of articles related to Politics.  It is one of many deletion lists coordinated by WikiProject Deletion sorting.  Anyone can help maintain the list on this page.   

Adding a new AfD discussion
Adding an AfD to this page does not add it to  the main page at WP:AFD.  Similarly, removing an AfD from this page does not remove it from the main page at WP:AFD.  If you want to nominate an article for deletion, go through the process on that page before adding it to this page.  To add a discussion to this page, follow these steps:
Edit this page and add {{Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/PageName}} to the top of the list. Replace "PageName" with the relevant article name, i.e. the one on the existing AFD discussion. Also, indicate the title of the article in the edit summary as it is particularly helpful to add a link to the article in the edit summary. When you save the page, the discussion will automatically appear.
You should also tag the AfD by adding {{subst:delsort|Politics|~~~~}} to it, which will inform editors that it has been listed here. You may place this tag above or below the nomination statement or at the end of the discussion thread.
There are a few scripts and tools that can make this easier.
Removing a closed AfD discussion
Closed AfD discussions are automatically removed by a bot.
Other types of discussions
You can also add and remove other discussions (prod, CfD, TfD etc.) related to Politics. For the other XfD's, the process is the same as AfD (except {{Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/PageName}} is used for MFD and {{transclude xfd}} for the rest). For PRODs, adding a link with {{prodded}} will suffice.
Further information
For further information see Wikipedia's deletion policy and WP:AfD for general information about Articles for Deletion, including a list of article deletions sorted by day of nomination.
This list also includes a sublist or sublists of deletions related to Politicians.

Delete. I couldn't find any media coverage, other than the programme listing on BBC Genome. p166 of Critical Mass: Bicycling's Defiant Celebration (search for "Ramsgate") has non-independent recollections from two people associated with the group: Ramsgate Critical Massers [...] were enthusiastic campaigners for environmental and social issues, and soon became well known in the East Kent area, even appearing on the local TV news. [... Aubi Fadra] was the secretary of the Ramsgate Flat Earth Society and Critical Mass from 1983/7. But searching for those names didn't find anything more.

This article is based on misinformation that's trending on social media; it relies on a bunch of sketchy sources published in the past few days that uncritically repeat false claims of election fraud. (The "zero votes" thing is a result of Orthodox Jewish bloc voting. [1]) I could find one okay source, which is Snopes examining the claims [2], but one source is not enough to justify an article, especially since Snopes devotes a lot of coverage to ongoing viral claims that have no enduring notability. It might be possible to keep the article if more good sources emerge that properly characterize the lawsuit and/or the social media trend, but it would still need WP:TNT.

As I indicated to the wikipedia editor who originally asked some questions on the site, it was created by a fan. I then added some updates, for instance It said I was writing regularly for Huffington Post. They published maybe 100 articles, but I'm not currently writing so I changed it to past tense. Part of the challenges is that I left writing for 12 years to run two nonprofits I founded where I wasn't able to write political pieces without making them politically vulnerable. So there are a ton of articles about me if you search "Paul Rogat Loeb" in Google or another search engine. But not all of them have the updated information because most are before 2012. So I could go through various statements in the wikisource and add links, but it would be time consuming. And there aren't public numbers on say how many copies I've sold, though there are probably articles among those for instance covering my lectures, that mention how many were sold at that time the articles were written.
So that's why I linked to the website.
Can you suggest how best to proceed without spending endless hours, like searching every publication and creating a separate link?  I really value Wikipedia and would like to have that listing remain.

WP:CRYSTAL BALL & WP:TOO SOON: Per Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/2025 New York's 21st congressional district special election, it was stated that we shouldn't be creating full articles for special elections in which the current representative's resignation is contingent on a future event taking place. We do not know when Rep. Green will retire or if the One Big Beautiful Bill Act will pass at all. We don't even know if the special election would take place in 2025. What happens if the bill doesn't pass? There's too much speculation into the creation of this article. I'm just not sure where we'd move the information about declared candidates. I also believe that we should make this type of prohibition a formal policy, if this deletion takes place. AG202 (talk) 04:12, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

MAHA Commission (edit | talk | history | protect | delete | links | watch | logs | views) – (View AfD | edits since nomination)
(Find sources: Google (books · news · scholar · free images · WP refs) · FENS · JSTOR · TWL)
It's unclear how this commission is independently notable of the main subject, that being the Make America Healthy Again campaign. This article barely gives any information about the commission, other than its establishment and a report published by it. The establishment of the commission isn't even mentioned on the main MAHA article, so it can be argued that this article existing as a separate (short stub-length) entity is detracting information from readers who want to learn about the subject. None of the cited sources provide significant coverage of the commission itself, aside from wider coverage of the MAHA campaign.
As the notability of an organisation is not inherited from the main subject, I think this article should be deleted and its relevant contents merged into the main article on the MAHA campaign. Grnrchst (talk) 15:29, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Delete or merge / redirect to Western alienation, per WP:ORG. Minor, fringe political party that ran in a few elections and by-elections, garnering less than 1% each time. No significant coverage in secondary, reliable sources available online, or in BC provincial archives that I could find. Perhaps it warrants a mention at Western alienation if reliable source(s) are found, but the topic has not had sources to demonstrate standalone notability in over two decades.

Keep The Western Canada Concept no longer has a presence of any significance in Canadian politics (thankfully), but it attracted a significant amount of media coverage in the 1980s and early 1990s, and it's been given non-trivial mention in several published works on Canadian politics. (A search for the phrase "Western Canada Concept" on the Internet Archive's "Search Text Contents" function yields 632 text sources. Even accounting for some duplication, that's a credible amount.)Many organizations that were notable in the pre-internet age don't have much of an online presence now; this is one of them. CJCurrie (talk) 01:06, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
By the way, I should mention that the Western Canada Concept actually won a seat in the Alberta provincial legislature in a 1982 by-election. (For context, see Olds-Didsbury and Gordon Kesler.) It's not correct to say they "garnered less than 1% each time." CJCurrie (talk) 22:45, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Keep. I agree with CJCurrie, there is significant coverage. Actually a decent amount of coverage online too, from what I can see. I've added a few sources, one of which would count for notability. Alongside the sources on archive.com identified above, there are also 2069 hits for "Western Canada Concept" on NewspaperARCHIVE.com and 13 on JSTOR.//Lollipoplollipoplollipop::talk 16:42, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

This has to be one of the best examples of Trumpcruft on Wikipedia. This is article is about a single letter, sent a few months ago. I held off nominating this article for deletion when it was first created, but it's been enough time now that I think it's clear it does not have enduring notability by itself; it has not received any extensive coverage since it was sent. Wikipedia is not a newspaper and this was not a significant event.

keep According to WP:NOMERGE, articles that are merged should not be excessively lengthy. Conversely, if an article has the potential for expansion, it should not be deleted. The article 2025 United States–Iran negotiations is lengthy and has the potential for further development. Also, the article about Trump's letter to Ayatollah Khamenei is quite well-known. It is a letter between two important and well-known people. Like the correspondence between Obama and Khamenei. Should this article also be deleted?

Fails WP:NBIO and WP:NPOL. The United States National Security Council employs almost 400 staffers, including numerous directors at Ceren's level. Many NSC staffers, including her former boss Eric Trager, a senior director, who has far more significant policy impact, don't even have an article. Coverage of Ceren is primarily due to a short-lived media controversy, not for enduring or substantive contributions to public policy. Routine job appointments or involvement in transient news cycles do not establish lasting encyclopedic notability, especially for a director who was in the job for 2 months.

Not sure how the creator of an article is relevant. WP:NPA applies. elijahpepe@wikipedia (he/him) 21:16, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
I did not make a personal attack; falsely accusing another editor of making a personal attack could be itself considered a personal attack. Calling out another editor for disruptive behavior, even if they may be acting in good faith, is not incivil. Although I usually refrain from calling out editors' past misbehavior, you have a history of prematurely creating problematic articles when notability has not been established; despite innumerable AfDs, you appear to not have learned from these past mistakes.

He didn’t say that you made a personal attack, nor even insinuate it. elijahpepe merely pointed out that the identity of the article’s creator is irrelevant to the AfD discussion, which I think is fair. I say keep; WP:TOOSOON is almost always subjective and therefore not a useful heuristic here (maybe ever). No reasonable person would call WP:TOOSOON if a major political figure had just died, because there’s a reasonable (but subjective) assumption that the event will become noteworthy. We document current events as though we are our future selves looking backwards. If this turns out to be a nothingburger, then scrap it. Getabucket (talk) 01:58, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
They wrote, "WP:NPA applies." NPA stands for "no personal attacks", in reference to our policy that prohibits petty insults and disparaging remarks, which I did not engage in. InfiniteNexus (talk) 02:58, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Oops I missed that, totally my mistake. Getabucket (talk) 13:16, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
"When in doubt, comment on the article's content without referring to its contributor at all" should be clear enough. Selbsportrait (talk) 23:29, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
That merely suggests that the safest way to avoid making personal attacks is to avoid referencing editors' behavior altogether, not that any reference to an editor's behavior is likely a personal attack. I agree with that statement and do generally avoid referencing editors' behavior, but in this AfD, I made an exception because I felt it was relevant context and made sure to frame it in a neutral, factual manner. InfiniteNexus (talk) 03:42, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
Logical fallacies: The argument uses an ad hominem fallacy by dismissing the article due to its editor (ElijahPepe) rather than its content. It misapplies WP:TOOSOON by claiming the topic is too recent without evidence of insufficient sourcing or lasting significance. Finally, it assumes WP:NOPAGE/10Y apply without proving the feud lacks verifiable notability, relying on bias over policy. Rosa Olmos (talk) 17:46, 8 June 2025 (UTC)

@Anchovyx: Sources aren't secondary just based on where they're published. A source can be both primary and secondary. For example, a news article that is mostly just reporting on a current event, with a sentence of analysis/interpretation, is still primarily a primary source. The secondary coverage (that sentence) is not "significant coverage". You cannot call the entire article secondary just because it has one sentence/paragraph of secondary (analysis/interpretation) in it. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:35, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

I agree that this, unfortunately, is a very possible outcome. I think the only way to fix this problem is to have some sort of restriction like WP:ECR on AfDs regarding current events. Too many inexperienced, drive-by editors too often rush to !vote to "save" these types of problematic articles because they are unaware that Wikipedia is a lagging indicator of notability, not a source of breaking news, and creating articles before notability is established is putting the cart before the horse.

Weak Keep - It's probably too early to see if this fails WP:NOTNEWS as the implications of this for the 2026 elections and 2028 elections if this is significant and long lasting will be profound.

Delete - per basically every other !vote before mine. The "keep" !votes are saying it meets NOTNEWS... when it doesn't. We don't (and can't) predict whether it's going to be lasting at all, and also the coverage about it is routine primary source journalism. By definition there aren't secondary sources at this point for a feud that has only come into the public eye in the last 24 hours. If/when there are secondary sources - such as large investigative journalism, rather than just reporting the news - WP:REFUND is that way (points). It is not a valid excuse that a REFUND may be merited in the future. As a distant second I would be okay with this being draftified in a userspace or in the Draft: space so it (and its history) can be maintained, to help placate the people claiming REFUND is too hard for them (I don't see any other reason "we may need to REFUND it" is a valid argument). -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 22:25, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
This does not appear to fall into any of the four categories of content which NOTNEWS advises against, none of that is routine coverage, and "Editors are also encouraged to develop stand-alone articles on significant current events." Your policy analysis is just weak. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 22:59, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Celebrity gossip and diaries. Even when an individual is notable, not all events they are involved in are. The feud may result in impacts to specific programs/services, and those can be covered in their respective articles. Further, point 2 specifies enduring notability of the event. There is no evidence this will be enduring in its notability, and it's not appropriate to assume it will be. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 23:07, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
This is neither gossip or diary style coverage. We can't assume either way on enduring notability, we don't have a crystal ball. If in a few years there is no more coverage than what we have now you are welcome to come back and delete it on lack of enduring coverage grounds. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 23:12, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
We don't have to assume either way. If there isn't evidence it's notable now, then it should be deleted now. If significant secondary coverage isn't available now, it should be deleted now. If such coverage comes out later, WP:REFUND is that way (points). -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 01:18, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

You have the burden to prove there is significant analysis/interpretation, because you're the one making the claim that it exists. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 05:19, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
If you can't prove a negative (which is false, e.g. Gödel's theorem), then how will you ever be able to support your claim that it's not significant?
Denial ain't that powerful. Selbsportrait (talk) 14:11, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Comment – I wrote this above as a reply but I'll repeat it here for visibility. Too many editors appear to not realize that Wikipedia is a "lagging indicator of notability", and rushing to create articles before notability is established is putting the cart before the horse; it should the other way around. WP:DELAY explains why we should not rush to create articles based on breaking news: we do not predict whether a topic "might" be notable in the future; we evaluate whether it is currently notable. If a topic that previously not notable later becomes notable, it can and will be reinstated then; however, until then, creating a standalone article is jumping the gun.

Delete Egads, what a woefully ill-informed dumpster fire of an article creation. Political disagreements are a routine part of politics, even between people who were once closer in agreement on issues in the past. This is plain WP:NOTNEWS with a healthy heap of WP:COATRACK, as the article just becomes a platform on which to criticize both subjects. We have enough articles where a minor mention of their alliance-turned-sour can be given a brief mention. It is not a stand-alone topic. Zaathras (talk) 23:38, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Wait. Not endorsing keeping or deleting, but while I wouldn't have created this article, I don't think nominating it for deletion the same day the news breaks is helpful, and it will be easier to assess whether notability will be sustained in a week or two. charlotte 👸♥ 23:42, 5 June 2025 (UTC)

There are enough deletionists around to keep that in check. At best it'd be an argument to burn everything from a page and start anew.I'm not sure how people can judge the importance of that topic.

You should read WP:NEWSPRIMARY. Coverage of current events by news is not secondary coverage. It is by definition primary. Investigative journalism, in depth analysis, and similar articles are secondary coverage. But there are none of those yet. Per GNG, secondary coverage is required - not just routine news coverage of current events, which, again, is primary. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 00:16, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Whether its primary or secondary depends on context... And in this context we primarily have coverage of tweets which would be the primary source with the news coverage being secondary. What that is supposed to prevent is making an article based on the tweets, not on articles about the tweets. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 00:32, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Nope. Coverage of tweets that just says "this person said this and here's a timeline of what happened" is not secondary. Secondary requires significant analysis/interpretation. A timeline or merely saying "this happened and here's a timeline of related events" is not secondary coverage. It's entirely possible for a source to report on information from elsewhere yet still be primary. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 00:53, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
That is not an accurate description of the coverage... We have interpretation of what the tweets mean and their context. There also appears to be a lot of analysis of how we got here and the implications going forward. We also have a number of notable individuals offering their opinion on the matter, and coverage of that. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 01:05, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
That's not secondary coverage. Saying "this is the historical context of 'how we got here'" is not analysis or interpretation. Offering opinions on the matter does not mean there is analysis or interpretation going on. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 01:17, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
You've selectively replied to my comment. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 01:34, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
No, I have not. You said That is not an accurate description of the coverage... We have interpretation of what the tweets mean and their context. I explained why that "interpretation of what the tweets mean and their context" is not secondary coverage. Explaining the definition of something is not secondary - likewise, explaining what the author thinks a tweet means is not secondary. The burden is on you to prove/show that there is "significant secondary" coverage. I look forward to you providing quotes (or another method) of showing what portion of sources you consider secondary in nature. I will happily revisit my position if your evidence is sufficient, alternatively, I will happily explain to you why your view of it being secondary/significant is wrong. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 01:40, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes, you have and continue to do so. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 01:52, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

Perhaps you could have told me to read WP:GNG first:
1. Presumed? That one is seldom on deletionists' side.
2. Significant coverage? Check:
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-06-05/elon-musk-trump-feud-full-timeline-of-the-public-meltdown
3. Reliable sources? Check:
https://www.cnn.com/business/timeline-elon-musk-trump-x-dg
4. Secondary sources? From your own source:
"Yale University's guide to comparative literature lists newspaper articles as both primary and secondary sources, depending on whether they contain an interpretation of primary source material."
In case you have difficulties finding commentaries:
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3wd2215q08o
https://www.vox.com/politics/415599/elon-musk-trump-feud-bill-contracts-nasa
5. Independent? That is usually implied by 4.
Also note:
"Deciding whether primary, secondary, or tertiary sources are appropriate in any given instance is a matter of good editorial judgment and common sense, and should be discussed on article talk pages."
To discuss usually implies one does not beg the question at hand, like you just did. Selbsportrait (talk) 00:38, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
No, coverage of tweets is not secondary. Secondary requires significant in depth analysis/interpretation. The current news is just "this happened, this is the history". That is not analysis/interpretation, much less in depth. A timeline is not analysis/interpretation. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 00:51, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
The timelines I offered establish significant coverage and reliable sources. And again, you are begging the question as to what is significant in depth analysis.
It shouldn't be that hard to find "analysis/interpretation":
https://www.wired.com/story/musk-trump-feud-venture-capitalists-pick-sides/

https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/musk-vs-trump-sniping-analysis-1.7553387
You may dispute that it's "significant" or "in depth", but then it's easy to do when one just has to argue by assertion.
What would convince you - ten monographs written by political scientists based on a statistical model with a 5-sigma threshold? Selbsportrait (talk) 01:14, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Significant and reliable are only two of the requirements. An article topic can have significant coverage in 100 reliable sources - but if none of that coverage is secondary, it's not notable. A paragraph of analysis in an otherwise primary source does not make it significant coverage in a secondary source. All must be met simultaneously - significant primary coverage does not count just because one small paragraph in it is secondary analysis. It must be significant secondary coverage. The burden is on you tyo identify why those sources show significant secondary coverage. Merely saying "analysis" in the title/headline doesn't matter when all it is is a timeline with maybe 3 sentences total of "analysis". -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 01:16, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

So you admit that it's only marked as analysis. Luckily, we don't just take sources at their word. You're free to quote the "analysis" that's present there. You have yet to do so, even with 3+ requests from me to do so at this point. The only valid assumption is that you are repeatedly not doing so because you can't - because it's not actually analysis that would qualify it as a secondary source and/or because any analysis present is in passing/so short as to not qualify as significant coverage. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:30, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

That's not analysis. That's simple news reporting - i.e. primary. A couple sentences of "analysis" interspersed within a timeline/news report does not "significant secondary coverage" make. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 03:58, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

"in 100 reliable sources"
Citation needed. Selbsportrait (talk) 02:24, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
WP:GNG: "Sources" should be secondary sources. No number of primary sources qualify a topic as notable. It could be 1000 primary sources. Doesn't make it notable. The requirement is that there be significant secondary source coverage. Not that there's lots of primary coverage of the topic with barely a sentence or paragraph of secondary coverage (analysis and/or interpretation). A timeline of events is not analysis or interpretation. There is yet to be shown any secondary coverage here. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:32, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
You said "in 100 reliable sources".
Where did you get that?
Arguing by bold is no better than arguing by assertion, or worse by denial. Selbsportrait (talk) 02:34, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Please reread my original response. The number is an example. 1000 primary sources with one sentence each of secondary (analysis/interpretation) coverage in them does not make "significant coverage in secondary sources" for notability. A source can be primarily primary even if it contains a small amount of analysis/interpretation that would be secondary. Even if there's 1000 such sources, that is still not the significant secondary coverage necessary for notability. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 02:37, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Whether a source is "primarily primary" or not is immaterial to the fact that it can be used for its secondary material. Which is the whole point of the discussion in the page you patronized me to read.
A source that contains secondary material is considered secondary when the secondary material is used as source.
1000 bits of analysis exceed what a page can contain, so please beware your synthetic examples.
And you still haven't told me what would convince you. Selbsportrait (talk) 02:46, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
That doesn't mean its notable. You cannot combine passing coverage in sources to meet notability. Each individual source used for notability must be significant secondary coverage. If it's only a sentence or short paragraph of secondary coverage, that is by definition not significant coverage. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 03:33, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Since the concept of secondary source is relative, contextual, and something that needs to be discussed as per your own citation, it is certainly not (or, if you prefer, not) a matter of definition.
Repeating the same naked denials over and over again without showing any understanding of the material you asked me to read is unconvincing, to say the least. Selbsportrait (talk) 03:55, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
You haven't provided any reasoning why the sources you cited were secondary. I've explained to you that one or two sentences, or a short paragraph, of secondary coverage does not "significant secondary coverage" make. It doesn't matter if it has 100 sentences of primary coverage - the secondary coverage is all that counts/matters. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 03:59, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
No, you haven't explained anything. You simply denied, denied, denied.
And now you contradict yourself: first you suggested that a source was not secondary unless it contained a majority of secondary content. Now, the primary content doesn't matter.
Make up your mind. Selbsportrait (talk) 05:11, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Those are not mutually exclusive arguments. You're the one making the claim that there is such - thus you're the one with the burden to prove it. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 05:20, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Yes, they are:
(1) A source, to be considered secondary, needs to contain a majority analytical content.
(2) A source, to be considered secondary, needs to contain analytical content.
(1) implies (2) but (2) does not imply (1).

It's not based on whether it's called analysis or not. It's based on whether it actually is analysis. Merely gathering social media posts and historical information is not analysis. There are a couple sentences that are analysis in that article. But a couple sentences is not "significant" coverage. -bɜ:ʳkənhɪmez | me | talk to me! 08:09, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
"Merely gathering social media posts and historical information is not analysis."
So you haven't read the piece, or you don't have a clear reading of "analysis, evaluation, interpretation, or synthesis of the facts".
Either way, I don't need to prove what I just said, right?

Keep per WP:RAPID and also because the coverage is already mostly sufficient for it to be notable and WP:NOTNEWS. I would be very surprised if this doesn't turn out to be obviously worthy of its own article in a few months. Loki (talk) 03:50, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Wait Weak Keep: Although the topics discussed within the article may certifiably be considered immediately notable for many, notability is not determined from the immediateness of its occurrence (WP:TOOSOON / WP:DELAY). Many of the KEEPS appear to mention the possibility for it to become notable in the next couple days or weeks. But, notability cannot immediately be determined either by the possibility of higher significance in a possible future based on speculation (WP:NOTCRYSTALBALL). But yes, this could indeed become a topic of higher importance within the next couple days. If the article is deleted and then it DOES become notable within the next couple days (causing a WP:REFUND), then this whole discussion would have been for nothing (WP:RAPID)... but I think that a KEEP should only be a reasonable choice IF and ONLY IF such notability is to occur within that short time frame. But if notability is not reached within that time frame, then it should be deleted and reconsidered IF and WHEN the topic becomes notable enough to where it would reasonably need a dedicated page instead as of a subtopic on a already existing page.

Redirect — This feud does not appear to be headed towards a prolonged conflict. I haven't found an appropriate redirect target yet; One Big Beautiful Bill Act may work. elijahpepe@wikipedia (he/him) 04:59, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Hold on a second. Did I read that right? InfiniteNexus (talk) 05:32, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
An article creator doesn't have to support their own article in an AfD request. The only reason that I created this was because there was a possibility of an impact here. That possibility is likely to dissipate tomorrow. Thus, no reason for this to exist. The page may still be useful as a redirect target, given that you searched for this exact title and there are likely others who did as well. It is still possible that there is something tangible to this, but from my reading of the situation (both internally and from public sources), Musk conflated the views of White House advisors with Trump's view. The length of time is not the issue here, for the record, but rather the consequences. Without a meaningful response beyond threats and market reactions. That said, I'm also open to Some1's idea, which I privately considered for several days before abandoning it. Writing an article on the two men's relationship would be a very difficult undertaking. The base is here for a section of such an article, but the author would also have to do a significant differentiation that may not be possible with a lack of sourcing. At present, I do not believe that such an article—which I simply would have called Elon Musk and Donald Trump—could exist. elijahpepe@wikipedia (he/him) 05:51, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
If you agree that this topic doesn't meet our criteria for notability, then you should not have created the article — you should have created it as a redirect. Creating an article before notability can be determined is called jumping the gun. Had this article not been prematurely created, we likely wouldn't be having this discussion (which won't be closed until several days later) at all. For the record, I agree: this "feud" looks to be nothing more than a few-hours-long online spat (happens all the time) that encompassed a bunch of angry tweets and sensational headlines (yellow journalism). InfiniteNexus (talk) 06:08, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
"If you agree that this topic doesn't meet our criteria for notability"
Timeline matters: one could have decided to create that page because it was noteworthy, and then found out that it should not. The strength of that belief also matters: one could believe that building an encyclopedia matters more than one's personal beliefs and that it's up to the consensus to decide.
Both the inclusionist and the deletionist have a role to play. The former have the facts, the latter the logic. It's very important that inclusionists don't get too categorical with the logic they apply, for we don't live in a world closed under deduction, and we need to fix first. Selbsportrait (talk) 15:45, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Notability is not temporary. It is not possible for a topic to be notable and then cease to be notable. If a topic is observed to "stop being notable", that means it was never notable in the first place. InfiniteNexus (talk) 16:25, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
We should not conflate "is believed to be notable by one editor" with "is notable". One editor can believe that an article is notable, or not; consensus can deem otherwise.
The implication you emphasized earlier is that an editor who submits an article for publication *should* (clarification pending on that type of obligation) believe that it's notable. My point is to say that belief needs not be categorical: an editor can change their mind, or don't put much credence in their beliefs.
Topics and pages are two different things. That a topic *is* notable (as in, forever and ever) does not imply we can't decide to repurpose a page for other reasons. Notability only obligates us to preserve valuable information. We could delete all the pages of the encyclopedia except one if one day everything worth nothing could fit on one page. Notability would thus be preserved.
(I know that's not plausible: it's just a thought experiment to make a point.)
That page is about a page, not an editor. Once a page has been created, it's out of the original editor's hands. Remonstrating should be reserved to personal talk pages, and only if an editor has formal authority over them. Selbsportrait (talk) 17:34, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
We should not encourage editors to unilaterally create articles on non-notable subjects because "they can always change their minds". It's true that they can change their mind, and it's true consensus can override their initial decision to create the article via AfD. However, this process is disruptive, time-consuming, effort-wasting, and could have been avoided if the original creator had exercised prudence and consulted on a talk page to gauge consensus on whether a subject could warrant its own page (i.e. a split proposal, or start a draft), rather than act unilaterally and then have buyer's remorse. As you can see with various !votes that boil down to "it shouldn't have been created, but it now exists, so oh well, let's save it, I guess" (which is basically the sunk-cost fallacy), editors are often hesitant to delete an article once it has been created, even though it is sometimes unfortunate but still necessary. InfiniteNexus (talk) 18:13, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
We should not encourage turning talk pages into trials either, yet you revealed that you were doing so all along one minute after I posted my previous comment.
And now you're going for armchair psychology about editors who disagree with you.
The question if any gun has been jumped has yet to be settled. So perhaps you should hold your horses yourself. Selbsportrait (talk) 18:31, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
We should not encourage turning talk pages into trials either, yet you revealed that you were doing so all along one minute after I posted my previous comment. I don't believe I said that? What statement are you referring to? InfiniteNexus (talk) 18:38, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
It's not what you say, but what you do with words that matters most. I'm referring to the comment you made one minute after this one. Since I made my comment at 17:34, it should be a comment a bit after that.
And just so we're clear, your implicit argument is of the form:
(P1) A* has been caught drunk typing a few times already.
(P2) A* was probably drunk typing this time too.
(P3) We should discount the output of those who type drunk.
(C) We should discount the value of what A* did because he was probably drunk typing at the time.
The alternative is to consider what A* did on its own merits.
There are contexts where this kind of ad hominem argument is valid. This page is not one of them.
I'm just using "drunk typing" for effect here. Replace that with any predicate you please. Selbsportrait (talk) 20:22, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
This is distracting too far from the main topic, so I'll probably disengage after this reply. I did not say, or even imply any of that: I did not say that we should delete this article because it was created by a problematic user (it's because it doesn't meet our notability guidelines), or that we should discount what they have to say (in fact, they agree with deletion/redirection), or that this AfD is a "trial" that should result in disciplinary action (that would be the wrong venue, and I do not think someone should be disciplined for one mistake, only given a stern warning), or that the user in question is acting in bad faith (they are not). I am not sure why you interpreted my words this way, but perhaps I did not articulate myself very well. InfiniteNexus (talk) 20:42, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
"I did not say, or even imply any of that"
Yes, you did. Right here:
other editors should be made aware of this context. The fact that you have been sanctioned in the past is demonstrative of the fact that I am not the only editor to share these legitimate concerns.
Let's spell it out:
"editors should be made aware" => this is relevant to the actual discussion
"this context" => the page under discussion is probably the result of drunk typing
"sanctioned in the past" => being caught drunk typing
"demonstrative" => an inference is being made
"legitimate concerns" => the argument is valid
Either you retract that "editors should be made aware", or you own what you're doing right now.
To disengage, one must engage first, and not ignore the points being made. Selbsportrait (talk) 23:18, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
OK, I didn't want to drag this on further, but you've made some serious allegations here. You originally wrote that I was turning talk pages into trials, suggesting that I was scrutinizing their entire edit history and calling for disciplinary action to be taken. I found this to be a gross exaggeration, so I asked for clarification; in response, you did not explain why you felt my comments were "trial"-like but invoked your drunk-typing analogy, asserting that I had suggested that we should discount the output of those who type drunk and discount the value of what A* did because he was probably drunk typing at the time, i.e. we should delete this article because of the article creator's history, and anything they say should be ignored. Again, I did not say this: I wrote editors should be made aware because this is relevant context to consider, not because it is the smoking-gun justification for deletion; otherwise, I would have phrased it as, "Delete, because the article creator often creates articles on non-notable current events and has been 'caught' doing so before." I also did not say anything about their "output" or "value" being irrelevant, which I obviously disagree with. You're making it sound like I presented a long list of irrelevant evidence of past misbehavior, hurled ugly insults and baseless accusations, and threatened to have them sanctioned, which is not the case and does not appear to be assuming good faith. InfiniteNexus (talk) 04:04, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
The "often creates" bit allows us to rephrase the argument:
(P1) A* often creates articles on non-notable current events.
(P2) A* probably did so this time too.
(P3) We should discount the output of those who often create articles on non-notable current events.
(C) We should discount the value of the page under discussion, i.e. it (probably) fails notability.
Without something like P3, P1 and P2 adds nothing to the current discussion. One reading of it is that this ad hominem argument supports the claim that the page is not notable. The alternative is that this argument does not "inform" how to judge the current page.
"Does not appear to be assuming good faith" is often used as an ad hominem too. It probably is one. Should it allow us to discount the value of the position it accompanies, i.e. that this page is non-notable? Let's hope not.
From times immemorial, Knights and Gnomes chased down Dragons away from thy wiki. While this sport can bring vigorous merriment, they are often followed by complaints about the sad state of undeveloped entries afterwards. Perhaps Knights should let our Dragon population grow for a little while, and organize jousting tournaments between themselves instead. Selbsportrait (talk) 06:27, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
"That possibility is likely to dissipate tomorrow."
I would take the other side of that bet, but I'm not sure why deciding what to do with that page should rest on the result of that bet.
A Musk-Trump page could be useful. A mention on the Big Beautiful Bill page is warranted either way, but it's really not the same thing. Selbsportrait (talk) 06:35, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
ElijahPepe, you could rename the feud article to Relationship of Donald Trump and Elon Musk to expand the scope, or create a Relationship of Donald Trump and Elon Musk article and redirect this feud article there. I do believe that the relationship between these two men is notable enough to warrant a standalone article. Some1 (talk) 10:04, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
A change in scope requires consensus, not to be done unilaterally. The closer of this AfD will determine whether there is consensus to change the scope of the article, or leave it as it is, or delete/redirect/draftify it. InfiniteNexus (talk) 16:25, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
If this article gets kept, then yeah, a change in scope and title would require consensus on the talk page. If this article gets deleted/redirected/draftified, that doesn't prevent another editor from creating a Relationship of Donald Trump and Elon Musk / Trump-Musk relationship article, which has a different (and broader) scope than this feud article. Some1 (talk) 15:23, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
Keep for now. The event is gaining immense media coverage, and it's still too soon whether to really consider this a short or prolonged conflict. Until we see what happens we should keep the article as is. Tofusaurus (talk) 05:01, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Wait per WP:RAPID. This article probably shouldn't have been created so soon, but the feud looks to be notable per WP:EVENTCRIT. It's had a substantial economic impact already and significant coverage from diverse sources. However, given the characters involved this could either blow over in a day or be a protracted conflict. So, it's too soon to say if coverage is WP:SUSTAINED. EvansHallBear (talk) 06:22, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Wait, as people said above. It's too soon to say. Trump is well known for getting into controversies with all kinds of people. Not all warrant an article, even if they are prominent people. In my opinion, we have to wait and see the consequences of this. Given a couple weeks, if nothing comes out of this, it should be deleted. Sure, there are plenty of news articles about this, but not everything that has news written about it warrants a Wikipedia article.
Not sure why this article was created in the first place. This AfD could've been avoided if the creator had waited a bit longer to see how things went. EatingCarBatteries (contributions, talk) 06:21, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

Thank you for bringing this up as I was not aware of this, but I must say I'm not surprised given my past dealings with this user. It appears based on this ANI discussion that they were topic-banned by the community for six months ... which expired last month. Almost immediately, their pattern of disruption has continued. It appears they did not learn from their all-too-brief period of sanction. InfiniteNexus (talk) 16:25, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
The articles I have created are here. Of the last nineteen since the topic ban, only this one has been sent to AfD. I did not create it as a one-sentence page, which was largely the issue, and I have been expanding it. This crusade against me is not appropriate in this AfD. There are other venues for this if you believe that I am acting maliciously. elijahpepe@wikipedia (he/him) 16:42, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
I do not believe you are acting in bad faith and did not accuse you as such; however, disruption made in good faith remains disruptive. I hope this AfD will serve as a reminder to refrain from jumping the gun and mass-creating articles about current events before notability is established — again, we do not predict whether a topic might be notable in the future. As I have stated above, this is not a personal "crusade" against you, but other editors should be made aware of this context. The fact that you have been sanctioned in the past is demonstrative of the fact that I am not the only editor to share these legitimate concerns. InfiniteNexus (talk) 17:35, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Mass creation does not appear to be at issue here. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 18:41, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

Striking because, although it was not my intention, some editors have raised concerns that this could be interpreted as a personal attack. InfiniteNexus (talk) 05:27, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
Oh its obviously a personal attack... What I'm saying is that its also wrong, this article under discussion here was not part of a mass creation and given that you've already seen their article creation history you know what. So you know for a fact that there is no issue with mass creation in this context but you brought it up anyway purely as a personal attack. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 14:46, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
Keep. Yes, the article was probably created too soon; however, I personally have no doubts about the notability and long-term significance of the event, which is why I'm voting for keep. Maxeto0910 (talk) 16:46, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Delete : Another article created too soon about something we will after forgot soon enough. Not everything that Trump does deserve an article, Wikipedia is not Wikinews, and I don't think there is any real benefit of having an article about this here, in an encyclopedia.

Keep This was all over the news yesterday and definitely took up most of the top news. Additionally this could flare up again if the BBB fails. BigRed606 (talk) 18:03, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
"This was all over the news" is not a valid argument to make. See WP:SUSTAINED: Brief bursts of news coverage may not sufficiently demonstrate notability. WP:TRUMPCRUFT is a great essay that talks about this as well. It's too early to make the call on whether this article meets our notability guidelines. InfiniteNexus (talk) 18:17, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Wikipedia:Arguments to avoid in deletion discussions is an essay and carries zero weight. The bit that actually matters says "may not" instead of "does not" I don't think you can say that isn't a valid argument. If its too early to make that call then its too early to delete (or even have this discussion), that argument only goes one way and its not in favor of deletion. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 18:40, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
People often say this when an essay is invoked (that they disagree with), but just because an essay is non-binding does not mean it's automatically wrong and should be immediately tossed aside as irrelevant. Essays often contain good advice, especially those that have been continually shaped by consensus. The fact that SUSTAINED says "may not" and not "does not" does not change the meaning: it is still true that press coverage does not guarantee notability, but SUSTAINED suggests that it may not be the case if proven otherwise. The editor who made this !vote did not explain why they believe this to be the case other than "it was in the news", which is a weak (if not invalid) justification. Regarding your last point, if it's too early to tell if an article meets notability guidelines, then by default, it is not notable. If it's too early to tell whether your chicken is done cooking, we don't assume it's cooked. InfiniteNexus (talk) 18:53, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
"Regarding your last point, if it's too early to tell if an article meets notability guidelines, then by default, it is not notable" if that was true then NOTNEWS wouldn't say "Editors are also encouraged to develop stand-alone articles on significant current events." Everything we have so far indictates that its notable and will remain so... Hard to imagine future biographies of either man aren't going to talk about this in-depth. The argument that it won't receive sustained coverage is nonsensical, even if it fizzles there will be sustained coverage. Horse Eye's Back (talk) 23:01, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Keep and rename Delete Gossip and trivia. WP isn't the 'National Enquirer'. Having reviewed much of the commentary here, the suggestion/proposal to rename the article more broadly (a la Relationship of Donald Trump and Elon Musk) would be the more productive choice.

Delete as this is obvious WP:TRUMPCRUFT WP:NOTNEWS and WP:TOOSOON also apply. The spectacle of two wealthy and powerful men bickering on social media might be appropriate for a discord but it's not encyclopedic.  Simonm223 (talk) 18:57, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Draftify It is way too soon to know if this social-media tiff between these two powerful men will have any lasting significance or be forgotten in a week when one of them tweets on some other subject.  Placing this in draft space for the next 6 months will avoid wasting the hard work that has already been done by the creator in assembling sources and documenting the early hours of the dispute so that, if it does have lasting significance, the article can be returned to mainspace or portions of it incorporated in other relevant articles.  However, if it does not have lasting significance, it will allow an admin to delete it at a point in time when its encyclopedic value or lack thereof is actually able to be determined. ~ ONUnicorn(Talk|Contribs)problem solving 20:14, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
I would also not object to the scope of the article being broadened to cover their entire relationship, per several !voters above. I also do not think anyone needs to wait for the AFD to close to begin that work. ~ ONUnicorn(Talk|Contribs)problem solving 20:26, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

Wait. The Trump-Musk fallout could have major political and economic consequences in the coming months and may even affect the 2026 United States elections.

It isn't clear to me what Wait means here - the usual !votes are "Keep", "Delete", "Merge", "Redirect". Does Wait mean "keep for now" or "delete and bring back if sustained"? One possibility is "Draftify", which would move the article out of main space for the moment, but that will make it hard for others to work on it. Personally, I'll go with Keep and link this to various articles about Musk and Trump, as appropriate. It also will need a redirect from "Donald Trump-Elon Musk feud".

Wait means 'keep for now', per WP:RAPID it was too quick to create an AfD, I was basically signalling that this AfD should result in a keep, but a few weeks later I could be swayed. I've always lent towards keep in this AfD, but I'm officially changing it to a weak keep as I've also grown increasingly unconvinced by the arguments in favour of deletion as the story has progressed and the article been expanded to detail the 2022 feud as well.

Comment I'd encourage @InfiniteNexus to WP:DROPTHESTICK, especially regarding whatever issue you may or may not have with this article's creator, which now seems to be sprinkled all around this AfD discussion. The creator's history has no bearing on the merits of whether or not this article is appropriate for inclusion on Wikipedia. RachelTensions (talk) 03:10, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
In this discussion, I have only discussed the article creator's past behavior twice: first, to note that they have a history of rapidly creating current-event articles that are often sent to AfD due to notability concerns; and second, in reply to another editor's comment on the user's previous topic ban. I did not make any additional references to their history other than in replies to those two statements; all other comments pertained to the notability of the topic. My intention was to alert !voters of the context of this AfD and to caution the editor against engaging in said behavior in the future, as it could and have been seen as disruptive. I did not anticipate the replies to those two comments to balloon out of control and create the impression that I am waging a personal war against the user, which was not my intention. I do apologize if my comments, which were intended as sincere advice, were interpreted as such, but I do maintain that the editor's background is relevant context, and I was mindful to remain civil but direct.

Wait as too soon for standalone article, even if notable enough not to delete. As referenced in the discussion, there is the previous feud that isn't even mentioned, though will excerpt that after this comment for consistency. Overall I think a Musk–Trump relationship based article, as other editors have already suggested, would be the best approach to broaden scope for a more notable topic; therefore including this content within as merely one part of a broader topic with long-term SIGCOV. Am otherwise opposed to merging to a Musk or Trump child article, as this is about both individuals, thus content doesn't belong to a child article of only one party to the dispute. CNC (talk) 08:04, 7 June 2025 (UTC)

Okay - but would that not be more valid as an expression or symptom of the presidency and/or character of Trump (as president) - and not so much worthy as being an event in and of itself...? Trump's behavior (however you feel about it) was the thing that made the impact - Covfefe was merely one instance of it.

Comment – Both The New York Times and The Washington Post have just published articles detailing the rift between Musk and Trump, which spanned several months and only culminated in this brief 24-hour online spat. We should not give WP:UNDUE weight to this incident while ignoring the larger context of their long-simmering tensions, so this should either be merged back into Political activities of Elon Musk or refactored into a larger article covering his role in the second Trump administration. It should not solely cover his relationship with Trump, as some have suggested, because we would be pulling too many unrelated details such as their earlier spat over Musk's acquisition of Twitter. Response to the Department of Government Efficiency (which was previously titled "Response to Elon Musk's role in the US federal government") could be merged into that hypothetical article well. InfiniteNexus (talk) 22:06, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
If the feud has a longer history, we should not give undue weight to the current events and the article should be expanded to cover that. I have no idea how the existence of more history lead you to the conclusion that this article should be deleted. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but it appears like you're grasping for reasons to keep this AfD alive. The assertion that this conflict spans months you just provided invalidates the vast majority of deletion support on the grounds of NOTNEWS and TOOSOON. Clearly the right decision if it is true that there is many months of history to this feud is to abandon the AfD and expand the curren feud article to detail the extensive history instead of shoving it into other tangently related articles. Scaledish! Talkish? Statish. 22:14, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
It would not be non-neutral and inaccurate to describe the leadup to their online spat as a "feud", leaning into sensationalist yellow journalism territory. We are not a tabloid, and no sources have characterized their entire relationship as a "feud". Articles dedicated to criticism or controversies are generally discouraged. I don't appreciate or agree with your characterization of my comment as grasping for reasons to keep this AfD alive; and yes, it is still TOOSOON to declare that this incident should exist as a separate article. InfiniteNexus (talk) 22:24, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
Most of your argument now appears to be in favour of a rename. Even then I may disagree, we have plenty of articles on feuds as it stands, and the fact that no source have characterized their entire relationship as a feud isn't compelling as this article isn't about their entire relationship, it is about the ongoing feud.
My comment on grasping is not made in isolation. It relates to the conduct I've observed throughout this AfD, starting with the undue criticism of ElijahPepe and followed by the vast number of arguments you've attempted. However my opinions on your motivations do not matter if you can make compelling arguments. Scaledish! Talkish? Statish. 23:16, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
My position has been consistent throughout the discussion: I do not think an article dedicated to the social media dispute that occurred on Thursday should exist until notability is established. I am less concerned with how this outcome is achieved, whether through redirecting to One Big Beautiful Bill, merging with Political activities of Elon Musk, refactored and renamed into a broader article, or outright deleted. The majority of my comments have been dedicated to demonstrating why this topic does not meet our notability guidelines. If the closer finds consensus against keeping, they will have to perform a WP:BARTENDER close. InfiniteNexus (talk) 23:43, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
The topic scope is not only about the recent feud between Musk and Trump that "that occurred on Thursday", but also the previous spat in 2022 that was also described as a feud at the time, per content. CNC (talk) 08:49, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
@CommunityNotesContributor: When did that happen, and why? The article is now pulling two unrelated incidents together to draw a forced connection, akin to WP:SYNTH. The previous "feud" (if it is even neutral to call it that without sources to support its use) is even less notable than last week's, so the latter would be the primary topic and the article should solely cover that. The article title doesn't necessarily imply there weren't other "feuds" in the past. We can mention it briefly in the "Background" section, but it probably does not warrant an entire paragraph per WP:UNDUE. I do not see consensus on the talk page for this change in scope; was this done unilaterally? InfiniteNexus (talk) 02:12, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Delete. Wikipedia is not a newspaper, nor is it a celebrity gossip magazine. Almost all the sources in this article are immediate reactions from 5 June to the twitter spat, followed by significantly less from 6 June, then only a couple sources from 7 June and none from 8 or 9 June (with a few sources from years ago synthetically attached to this subject). If this subject does not have significant coverage enduring enough to make it even a few days past the immediate gossip circles, then it's hard to accept that this is meets the criteria for a notable event. If this turns into anything, then we can revisit it, but right now, it's just gossip with no wider consequences. --Grnrchst (talk) 15:39, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Notability is not determined by the sources in the article but by all extant sources on the topic, you will easily be able to find signficant coverage from the 8th and 9th. I suggest a google news search limited to the past 24 hours, that will turn up pieces like these: [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11] Horse Eye's Back (talk) 15:51, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
I'm wary of replying to so many comments, but I keep seeing this argument being used. However, the existence of sources alone isn't the sole determinant of notability, and it doesn't automatically warrant a standalone article. Some topics may meet sourcing requirements but are nonetheless better off as a section on an existing article, per WP:NOPAGE. See WP:N: [GNG] is not a guarantee that a topic will necessarily be handled as a separate, stand-alone page. Editors may use their discretion to merge or group two or more related topics into a single article. We also need to consider the WP:LASTING significance of a topic through measures such as the WP:10Y test: is the topic likely to remain notable in the long run, or will it simply be a blip in time that we're devoting undue emphasis on? WP:EVENTCRIT sets a higher bar than some other topics on Wikipedia. Pardon of Hunter Biden; Death of Matthew Perry; Controversies surrounding Ezra Miller. These topics all received brief bursts of widespread news coverage, but they do not and should not have standalone articles because they are ultimately fleeting events with little historical significance. If this event ends up having significant ramifications later on, then we can consider restoring it in the future. InfiniteNexus (talk) 19:00, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
That is a red herring, I did not argue that the existence of sources alone is the sole determinant of notability, or that it automatically warrants a standalone article. Also note that WP:10YT instructs "Above all else, editors should avoid getting into edit wars or contentious deletion discussions when trying to deal with recentism." so if you're trying to use it to argue for deletion you simply do not understand what it is saying.

Merge to Politics of Elon Musk: Per the nominator, This could easily fit better in individual sections such as Politics of Elon Musk.  Per WP:ATD-M, we should merge rather than delete when we can.  Looking at the 'Second Trump administration' and 'Musk on the Big Beautiful Bill' sub-sections along with the '2025 feud' section, I think that there is sufficient content that could be merged into one or more articles.  I am not opposed to additional merging or even redirecting, but am opposed to deletion.For some additional comments, I don't see NOTNEWS as convincing when this wasn't a routine event based on the definition at ROUTINE.  Per routine: Per Wikipedia policy, routine news coverage of such things as announcements are not sufficient basis for a whole article. Planned coverage of scheduled events, especially when those involved in the event are also promoting it, is considered to be routine. Wedding announcements, sports scores, crime logs, and other items that tend to get an exemption from newsworthiness discussions should be considered routine. Routine events such as sports matches, film premieres, press conferences, etc. may be better covered as part of another article, if at all. Run-of-the-mill events—common, everyday, ordinary events that do not stand out—are probably not notable. This is especially true of the brief, often light and amusing (for example bear-in-a-tree or local-person-wins-award), stories that frequently appear in the back pages of newspapers or near the end of nightly news broadcasts ("And finally" stories).  Wasn't an announcement, wasn't a scheduled event, wasn't run of the mill.  For the rest, this isn't a Who's Who violation as both are notable nor does this appear to be either a NOTDIARY issue or an original reporting issue.  I believe most of those citing NOTNEWS should clarify the violation more as just pointing at a policy isn't helpful and leaves no good explanation.  Also, I will note here that news coverage has continued into this week: USA Today, New York Times, CNN, Al Jazeera, PBS.  --Super Goku V (talk) 00:53, 13 June 2025 (UTC)

(Find sources: Google (books · news · scholar · free images · WP refs) · FENS · JSTOR · TWL)
I'm by no means a fan of dedicated criticism articles, but I think this takes the cake as one of the worst ones. This article was created 20 years ago as a POV fork of the libertarianism article and has since been indiscriminately collecting together a series of criticisms without any connection to one another. The article reads as a long repetitive list of "This person says libertarianism is bad for this reason", followed by a lengthy quote, and cited almost exclusively to primary sources, without any reliable secondary sources to provide a throughline. A cursory search on Google Scholar doesn't come up with many sources that are specifically about the criticism of libertarianism, which is instead covered within the context of the subject as a whole. 
Article deletion was raised some time ago, but nothing ultimately came of it, so I thought I'd open a discussion about it now. I don't think this article serves any value to our readers as it currently exists, it is just a fork with an inherently non-neutral POV. Any relevant overarching criticisms specific to libertarianism can easily be integrated into the main article, and the individual opinions of philosophers can be merged into their own articles. Obviously I'd be happy to hear out any alternatives to deletion people might have, and possible ways to improve the article, but right now I don't see a way of fixing its fundamental issues.

I want to note that this is an article copy of Draft:AAPA and Black Power (previously draftified after Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/AAPA and Black Power). It looks like a few students were working on it this past semester and then copy-pasted it here, so if the article is kept, that draft should be redirected here and the attribution fixed. My read of the article is that it's mostly stitching together sections that would be better covered as subtopics in the corresponding articles (in particular, the amount of detail about Yuri Kochiyama kind of turns her into a metonym for an entire social movement). My recommendation would be to delete this copy and merge relevant info from the draft into Yuri Kochiyama, Asian American Political Alliance, and maybe George Floyd protests or Killing of Akai Gurley. @AnitaConchita If you're continuing work with the students still, I'd encourage exploring how this info can be incorporated there. hinnk (talk) 07:00, 13 June 2025 (UTC)

I do not believe that it has ever been the intention of Wikipedia to raise to article levels minor electoral areas in local government as such.

For national election constituencies, that is true.  But this is only for electing local government.  Such wards do not see news articles speculating about who might win, or possible candidates.  Those elected are unlikely to ever generate GNG coverage such as would lead to them getting an article.  It is a very different scale than a constituency for national government.
If this is to be retained, does that mean that we ought to have a goal of creating articles for all 8,694 such wards in th UK?  Not to mention equivalents worldwide. Kevin McE (talk) 06:54, 4 June 2025 (UTC)
Delete or merge to City of Colchester. Local city ward lacks notability and fails GNG. There is no precedent or basis for any suggestion that constituencies are automatically notable, particularly at the local level with only a few thousand voters. Most of the other thousands of articles are at the national or regional level and are substantially larger entities (and many of them should also be deleted or merged). The suggestion that the article is well-sourced is simply laughable, the only sources are simple election results data for the council, nothing remotely resembling significant coverage. We are not a database for every minor election result without context. Reywas92Talk 03:40, 4 June 2025 (UTC)
Merge to City of Colchester; it's just a local ward. No inherent notability and no SIGCOV. The electoral records can be linked form the main page. CohenTheBohemian (talk) 13:07, 4 June 2025 (UTC)
What would be merged?  Are you proposing that the article for the city should have every result of every ward election since the area became a local authority? Or that this one ward somehow gets exceptional treatment? Kevin McE (talk) 18:48, 4 June 2025 (UTC)
Merge the prose (about five lines), and link the tables of results. CohenTheBohemian (talk) 01:52, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
Thanks for replying, but why would the City of Colchester article be improved by having some trivial data about a former ward, while a couple of dozen other former and current wards do not have the same details given?  Or why the results of this one (former) ward should be preserved and reported while those of the others are not? Kevin McE (talk) 06:59, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
I won't be crying into my beer if this article is deleted, but WP:ATD states that "If editing can address all relevant reasons for deletion, this should be done rather than deleting the page" and WP:ATD-M that "articles that are short and unlikely to be expanded could be merged into larger articles". So my reply is based on the deletion policy.
Speaking of which: per below, instructions for multiple-article AfDs are at WP:BUNDLE. Hope this helps. CohenTheBohemian (talk) 15:13, 10 June 2025 (UTC)
By no means intended as an attack on you, but I think it is a huge flaw of the deletion system that an instruction gets sent to a talk page telling editors there that material from another article is to be incorporated into it, with no consideration of whether it is appropriate or proportionate, often when there has been no awareness on the part of the editors committed to the target page that such a thing is under discussion.  It comes across (again, by no means intending this as personal to you) as an extraordinary systemic arrogance that one part of Wikipedia tells another what it must do with no consultation at all.
But that is a bigger issue than the article at hand.
Thanks to the signposting to WP:Bundle, but that doesn't seem to deal with later additions to an AfD, so I'll see what happens here, then propose it if there is (what seems to me) a suitable outcome here. Kevin McE (talk) 19:21, 10 June 2025 (UTC)

I'm not sure what the method is for turning a simple AfD into a multiple article AfD, but anything that can be said about this article seems likely equally true of Castle (Colchester ward).  And if both of those are deleted, I would suggest that Template:Electoral wards in the City of Colchester, being then is void, should equally be removed. Kevin McE (talk) 16:17, 9 June 2025 (UTC)

Bit of a tricky one I think, given that it gets mentioned all the time, e.g., for their failed Georgia bid and it's considered a major vendor in the industry (see Axios, Engadget), but most of the more in-depth sources are the sort of WP:TRADESy sources that we would not typically consider to meet WP:ORGCRIT, for example InformationWeek / Dark Reading and Xconomy.
There are a couple of scholarly sources mentioning the company also, for example, Bernhard et al. (2019) and his later PhD thesis, Bernhard (2020), but I don't think it quite meets the criteria for depth of coverage. The best news source I found would probably be Washington Monthly, but again I don't think it quite meets the "directly and in-detail" threshold that we would need to write an article from it.
It would be a bit of a shame to have absolutely nothing on the company, but there are a few places where it is mentioned, so I figure I'd propose it as a redirect to Election audit § Ballot scans for 100% audits (given they're best known for their auditing software), or one of the other places where Numbersinstitute has added a mention.

Article has a history of promotion through environmental & civic projects. Significant portions of this article are just slightly re-worded from the Cordelia Scaife May page. Aside from the greenwashing and other projects that were listed prior to my removing of them, there is hardly enough for an article here. It was founded by May, funds anti-immigration causes, and received a large sum of money when May died. The only other piece of information here is that the foundation funded groups designated by hate groups by the SPLC, which could obviously be implied from their anti-immigration stance. This article is unnecessary & inherits at least a portion of it's notability from May, who was also the org's chairperson from its founding until her death in 2005. 30Four (talk) 07:20, 27 May 2025 (UTC)

These types of references are aforementioned above. A search for non-local articles that significantly cover the foundation turned up The Chronicle of Philanthropy, Philanthropy News Digest and Inside Philanthropy (The latter is a paragraph in a broader story about CIS and the former two are WP:SPIP.

Reference #6 is the Southern Poverty Law Center, not a city newspaper. Reference #13 is not a blog. Reference #10 is definitely about more than just sponsorships and greenwashing. That source is a 1,400 word story about the organization covering its history and impact (and only 2 paragraphs are about Cordelia May). Finally, I don't see how the profile in The Chronicle of Philanthropy is self-promotion. The Chronicle of Philanthropy is a print magazine with actual writers.

A niche term at best, a made-up term at worse to promote an Indian counterpart to the American second lady. None of the existing citations mentions the term "second lady" and are only used to support claims that certain persons are wives of the Indian vice president. A search on Google does not yield any evidence of established endonymic usage of the term second lady of India (which is not merely a substitute for vice president wife).  Searching "Uprashtrapati Bhawan hostess" also does not yield any quality sources.

Comment The premise is flawed. You are operating under the premise that "second lady" (mostly an American-centric term) means the same as vice president spouse. My objection is that the article is largely fiction because there is not a widely documented role of "Uparashtrapati Bhavan hostess" Hariboneagle927 (talk) 13:11, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

Delete  – The comparison between the (Category:Second ladies and gentlemen of the United States) page or category is not appropriate. According to Wikipedia's guidelines, such a page seems justified, but it requires reliable sources for support. The sources available for this page do not meet the criteria outlined in WP:GNG, so the page does not fully comply with this guideline. For example, the wife of the U.S. Vice President receives significant news coverage and publicity in India[22][23][24][25][26][27][28][29][30][31][32][33][34][35][36], whereas in India, the wife of the Vice President does not receive similar publicity or news coverage. If there is any coverage, it typically mentions them in connection with their husband. If you believe I am mistaken, please provide 4-5 sources that confirm news coverage specifically for the wife of India's Vice President.-SachinSwami (talk) 07:20, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Comment: Geez, I don't know and don't think I can !vote one way or the other until digging into the sourcing beyond what we are seeing here, but this is a tough call.  On the one hand, the present sources don't seem to provide the focused, subject-oriented coverage we'd normally want to see to support GNG.  On the other hand, I just have a hard time believing that we couldn't hit that threshold--not withstanding SachinSwami's observations, which I do consider valuable insight.  It's just that we don't necessarily need 4-5 such sources containing detailed coverage.  2-3 and a smattering of other indirect references will probably get this past an initial AfD.  It does remain to be demonstrated that this threshold can be met.  But I'd be kind of shocked if it couldn't honestly, given the size of India's media market and the footprints of its national political leaders? SnowRise let's rap 08:48, 9 June 2025 (UTC)
Comment as what SachinSwami said the spouse of the vice president of India barely receive any coverage than say the US Second Lady Usha Vance, probably due to her heritage. I might give a nudge that this deletion nomination is for the supposed role of Second Lady of India, not the "vice president's wife". Because the US Second Lady is an actual role with its own proper documentation that is the differentiating factor here. Excluding sources which merely says "woman was Vice President's wife", this article has literal zero sources. The term "second lady" (not as a merely as a substitute term for vice president's wife) does not even get mentioned. Doesn't mean that the United States have a second lady, we got to force one on other countries. Hariboneagle927 (talk) 13:09, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

Many mayoral positions in Colonial America were unelected (other than maybe a local council), undesired, or both (ex: It wasn't uncommon for Philadelphia's selected Mayors of the 1700's to prefer to face criminal charges or flee the area than to take office) so there is likely little significant coverage.

Delete, obviously without prejudice against recreation in the future if somebody with access to archived Chilean media can write and source something more substantive than this. Mayors are not automatically entitled to Wikipedia articles just for existing, and have to show significant press coverage enabling us to write a substantive article about their political impact — specific things they did, specific projects they spearheaded, specific effects their mayoralty had on the development of the city, and on and so forth. But this basically just states that he existed, and just cites the absolute bare minimum of sourcing needed to prevent it from being speedied as completely unsourced, without adding any of the more substantive content or sourcing that we would actually need to see. Bearcat (talk) 16:49, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Keep: The article sufficiently meets the notability guidelines for politicians, as it addresses the first topic of politicians who have held province–wide offices, in this case, that of mayor of Viña del Mar.
Just as there are political figures with extensive coverage without holding an official position, in this case, it is a figure with historical notoriety without much media coverage. Carigval.97 (talk) 19:14, 5 June 2025 (UTC)
Mayor of a city is not a "province-wide" office. It's a local office that falls under NPOL #2, where the notability test depends exclusively on media coverage and cannot be passed without that. Bearcat (talk) 11:53, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
According to the rules, media coverage is a second important point, not necessary exclusive (that's why I was talking about cases where there are political figures without positions, but with sufficient references). Similarly, that position –mayor of Viña del Mar– is a province-wide office: that important city in Chile is a town in the Province of Valparaíso. Mr. Trejo has encyclopedic relevance as a mayor of a large city in Chile.Carigval.97 (talk) 10:08, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
Media coverage is essential to passage of WP:GNG, not a mere option that can be bypassed. NPOL does not say that media coverage is optional; even a politician who does pass NPOL #1 (which a mayor does not) still has to have GNG-worthy sourcing too, and the only pass they get is that as long as their holding of the office is properly verifiable, we don't rush their article into the delete bin for not already being in a better state than it is — we give it time for improvement to a GNG-compliant standard, because it's an automatic given that the article will be improvable.
But mayors don't get the same indulgence: mayors only get articles if and when passage of the criterion for local politicians has already been shown off the bat, because there isn't the same guarantee that every mayor of everywhere can always be improved to a GNG-compliant standard. No politicians, at any level of government, are ever exempted from having to have GNG-worthy media coverage — there are just some levels of government at which the officeholders are given a grace period for improvement, and some levels of office at which they aren't given the same benefit of the doubt, but there is no level of government at which people are exempted from having to cite GNG-worthy sourcing at all.
I don't think you understand the definition of "province-wide", either. The fact that a city is in a province does not render the city's mayor into a province-wide officeholder, as he's mayor of the city and not mayor of the whole province. A province-wide office is one that has province-wide jurisdictional authority, like a governor or a provincial-level legislator, not a mayor of an individual town or city within the province. Mayors are local officeholders under NPOL #2, not province-wide officeholders under NPOL #1, which is precisely why a mayor cannot be exempted from having to pass GNG on media coverage. Bearcat (talk) 14:59, 6 June 2025 (UTC)
I understand your reasons, Bearcat, but Trejo's management as mayor of Viña del Mar is reflected in the document that refers to his social policies regarding legal aid, as well as in press reports that mention his management of the Viña International Festival. The lack of more digital news is due to the fact that the internet was not sufficiently widespread at the time. However, this lack is complemented by sufficient historical documents that do give him prominence in his field: the history of the mayoralty of Viña del Mar.
Regarding "No politicians, at any level of government, are ever exempted from having GNG-worthy media coverage", it's regrettable that there are cases where even long-standing English officials, such as Arthur Henderson, Baron Rowley (Labour), have few references, as well as Sidney Jones, Mayor of Liverpool, who does not register digital press releases, but rather press sources. Despite this, their notability lies in the positions they have held.
Finally, a city's case may remain provincial, but autonomous. Similarly, and being a local city, Viña del Mar is an important cultural and economic location (services, tourism). Based on this, and the fact that Trejo is a politician, the subject of the biography has sufficient notoriety to have held said office, as verified by official digital archives of proven reliability (Universidad Alberto Hurtado and notes from the Judicial Corporation).

Please don't bring up WP:WHATABOUT "arguments". Geschichte (talk) 08:36, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Keep: It's not just a matter of media coverage for the tenure of a politician's biography, a mayor in this case. The most important thing here is that "Politicians who have held international, national, or subnational office (such as members of national legislatures, governors, or mayors of large cities) are presumed notable." In this case, Viña del Mar is one of the largest cities in the country and is an integral part of Greater Valparaíso, the second largest urban agglomeration in Chile. — Preceding unsigned comment added by Igallards7 (talk) 3:45, 7 June 2025 (UTC) 
Keep: per Igallards7. The article has also been significantly expanded since the nomination. Luis7M (talk) 18:38, 8 June 2025 (UTC)
Comment WP:NPOL does not state that mayors of large cities are presumed notable. The correct language in NPOL is "Major local political figures who have received significant press coverage." The language does not specify city size or even position a local government. The standard for all local politicians is what Bearcat describes earlier - the need to "show significant press coverage enabling us to write a substantive article about their political impact." This is true for a mayor of a population of 49, or a population of 32 million. In practice, this means that a local official should meet and possibly exceed WP:GNG to have a stand alone page. --Enos733 (talk) 20:52, 8 June 2025 (UTC)

I suppose you need to read WP:OSE. Howard the Duck (talk) 09:23, 7 June 2025 (UTC)
KEEP the article.
Junie Yu is notable based on his extensive political career. He served as mayor for three consecutive terms (June 30, 2007 – June 30, 2016) and as vice-mayor for three consecutive terms (June 30, 2016 – June 30, 2025). Furthermore, he unseated incumbent Mayor Julius Caesar Herrera in both the 2013 and 2025 elections, and is set to assume office again as mayor by June 30, 2025. This consistent holding of significant public office directly meets Wikipedia's notability guidelines for politicians (WP:NPOLITICIAN) and provides ample ground for "significant coverage" under WP:GNG. 1bisdak (talk) 01:50, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
To closing admin, subject of the article fails WP:NPOLITICIAN. I suppose 1bisdak has to paste the provision on that policy where Yu applies? Being mayor for 3 terms, vice mayor for 3 terms, unseating the previous mayor, and defending the mayoralty doesn't make you pass WP:NPOL. I would really highly suggest 1bisdak to rean and understand WP:NPOL; it's not even that long.
As for WP:GNG, while there were improvements in the sourcing in the article since June 6, these were a court case (WP:PRIMARY), and a self-published Scribd document (again, WP:PRIMARY). As prior sourcing failed WP:RS, and added ones still do not pass WP:RS, the article still fails WP:GNG. Howard the Duck (talk) 14:29, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Junie Yu's six consecutive terms as mayor and vice-mayor (2007-2025) demonstrate sustained "significant elected office" under WP:NPOLITICIAN.
His unseating of incumbent Mayor Julius Caesar Herrera twice (2013 and 2025) further proves his political notability and the likelihood of significant coverage.
While some current sources might be weak, his long tenure and political impact mean verifiable, independent sources should exist, meeting WP:GNG. The issue is finding them, not a lack of notability.

As WP:Notability states, "Determining notability does not necessarily depend on things such as fame, importance, or popularity." 1bisdak (talk) 01:18, 12 June 2025 (UTC)
The exact phrase "significant elected office" (your quotes) doesn't appear in WP:NPOLITICIAN.
People defeating incumbents do not merit Wikipedia articles for most of the time, unless those offices are the ones found in WP:NPOLITICIAN.
Where are those WP:RS sources? You've been arguing about importance without actually demonstrating it by finding sources. Sources about his offspring don't count. We need actual sources not theoretical ones, "or they're out there". This person's career spans the last 10 years or so, WP:LINKROT should not be an issue for internet sources. Howard the Duck (talk) 13:45, 12 June 2025 (UTC)

I would agree that if it were being created now then it would be problematic but it would ADD burdens, admittedly for only a few people but us nevertheless, rather than making anything more simple or easier to use. Please keep this genuinely very helpful article. Kepleo123 (talk) 21:02, 22 May 2025 (UTC)

Keep this is a valid navigational article, even if it might need additional sources beyond the single one. A merge is not a good option because the other article is too long already. SportingFlyer T·C 16:46, 23 May 2025 (UTC)
How is it a valid navigational article? Nearly all losing candidates don't have articles to which to navigate, so the main navigation is just to the winner, but we already have List of MPs elected in the 2024 United Kingdom general election that covers that. How many different ways do we need the same information? Bondegezou (talk) 10:02, 24 May 2025 (UTC)
Keep. What is it's value? Its value is in its use. I use the page regularly to access information. I find it an invaluable resource. We would not want to delete something if there is data showing that the page is well used. No data is being provided to justify its deletion. Graemp (talk) 11:55, 27 May 2025 (UTC)
Just because nearly all of them don't doesn't mean there's anything at all invalid about this particular article. SportingFlyer T·C 16:54, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Delete WP:NOTDATABASE, WP:NOTDIRECTORY and seeing as there is one single source for all this information it may fall in a grey area copyright-wise per WP:ONESOURCE. Orange sticker (talk) 09:51, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
This isn't a database as it's properly contextualised and it's not a resource for conducting business. SportingFlyer T·C 16:55, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
Neither of those things have anything to do with it being a database or not. WP:NOTDATABASE discourages indiscriminate lists with no context, that's that this article is. Orange sticker (talk) 14:50, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Furthermore there are other sources available and it's a list of factual information, so there's no copyright issue. SportingFlyer T·C 16:55, 28 May 2025 (UTC)
I don't think anyone is disputing the veracity of the information but whether this indiscriminate list is encyclopaedic content. To those saying it is useful information, yes, that's why [whocanivotefor.co.uk] went to the trouble of compiling, creating and hosting this list. Wikipedia is not a carbon copy archive of every useful fact on the internet. Orange sticker (talk) 14:53, 11 June 2025 (UTC)

Comment: WP:NOTDATABASE has been mentioned twice but none of the points there are relevant to this AfD. The more relevant link would seem to be WP:NOTDIRECTORY. Stockhausenfan (talk) 23:58, 29 May 2025 (UTC)
It's not a directory, either - it's a list. SportingFlyer T·C 02:38, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Keep As it's useful and encylopeidc. AlessandroTiandelli333 (talk) 15:02, 30 May 2025 (UTC)
Comment. I think this is very useful and if something like this is precluded there should be change in policy. I don't see how it is substantially different from 1982 United States House of Representatives election. I don't know enough about WP:DIRECTORY to have an educated vote here. --Mpen320 (talk) 23:35, 3 June 2025 (UTC)
1982 United States House of Representatives election doesn't exist, so I'm unclear what point is being made here? Bondegezou (talk) 14:42, 11 June 2025 (UTC)
Comment the sole source of this table has a copyright notice saying it is owned by the Democracy Club Community Interest Company, who sell the data they compile commercially. [41] Should this be brought to WP:CPN? Orange sticker (talk) 08:26, 4 June 2025 (UTC)
The website's design and prose is copyrighted. A publicly available list of names that they took from government sources is not a creative work that can be copyrighted, even if they sell compilations that include it. Reywas92Talk 14:04, 4 June 2025 (UTC)

Delete: There's no notability in simply standing for election. As this event has passed, we only need a list of the winners of the election. We aren't an election wiki, listing each and every person that ever ran for an election at any point in time, anywhere on the planet. Oaktree b (talk) 19:19, 6 June 2025 (UTC)

Keep as a valuable list of information. This page was started after a discussion which involved the splitting of the Candidates in the 2024 United Kingdom general election page. Moondragon21 (talk) 19:34, 19 June 2025 (UTC)

Fails to pass WP:NPOL as an unelected member to a national body, and city council position is not inherently notable. Coverage all focuses on either failed congressional campaign or general coverage of the Marikina City Council. Yoblyblob (Talk) :) 18:24, 22 May 2025 (UTC)

Draftify and redirect to Marikina#Local government: Still a major figure in local politics; gaining notability in the foreseeable future is not out of the equation. On a related note, if that is the threshold, then Xyza Diazen should also be rediscussed.

@TofuMuncher if you want to take action on that page you can. Politicians have notability requirements, where if they hold a certain position they can be considered automatically notable, but they can still be notable if they have been the subject of significant coverage.
