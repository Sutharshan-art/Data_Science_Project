James Brown (born 1970/1971) is an American politician who is currently serving as the 17th Montana State Auditor since 2025. As a Republican he served as a member of the Montana Public Service Commission.


== Biography ==
Brown is from Beaverhead County and, as of mid-2024, works as an attorney in private practice.


== Political career ==
In 2022, Brown ran and lost a race for Montana Supreme Court to the incumbent justice Ingrid Gustafson. While the office is considered non-partisan, Montana Republican leaders supported Brown early in his campaign, setting the stage for an election with partisanship overtones. The race was named as the most expensive in Montana history for the office, and Brown blamed his loss on the "millions of dollars in liberal money" that had flooded the state in the final weeks of the race.
