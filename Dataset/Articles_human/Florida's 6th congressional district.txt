Florida's 6th congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Florida. The district is located on the Eastern Florida Coast and stretches from south of Saint Augustine to South Daytona and inland to the southwest to the outskirts of Ocala, Leesburg and Sanford. It includes the city of Daytona Beach.
From 2003 to 2013, the district stretched from the St. Johns River and Jacksonville, sweeping through North Central Florida, encompassing portions of Gainesville and Ocala, and meandered down to the northern tip of the Greater Orlando area in Lake County. It included all of Bradford and Gilchrist counties and portions of Alachua, Clay, Duval, Lake, Levy, and Marion counties. Most of this district is now the 3rd district, while the current 6th covers most of the territory that was previously in the 7th district.
From 2013 to 2018, the district was represented by future Governor of Florida and 2024 Republican presidential candidate Ron DeSantis. From 2019 to 2025, the district was represented by former U.S. national security advisor Mike Waltz.
The district is currently represented in the U.S. Congress by Republican Randy Fine, who took office on April 2, 2025.
